            <p>by Sahra Uygun, Cheng Peng, Melissa D. Lehti-Shiu, Robert L. Last, Shin-Han Shiu</p>

Gene co-expression has been widely used to hypothesize gene function through guilt-by association. However, it is not clear to what degree co-expression is informative, whether it can be applied to genes involved in different biological processes, and how the type of dataset impacts inferences about gene functions. Here our goal is to assess the utility and limitations of using co-expression as a criterion to recover functional associations between genes. By determining the percentage of gene pairs in a metabolic pathway with significant expression correlation, we found that many genes in the same pathway do not have similar transcript profiles and the choice of dataset, annotation quality, gene function, expression similarity measure, and clustering approach significantly impacts the ability to recover functional associations between genes using <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> as an example. Some datasets are more informative in capturing coordinated expression profiles and larger data sets are not always better. In addition, to recover the maximum number of known pathways and identify candidate genes with similar functions, it is important to explore rather exhaustively multiple dataset combinations, similarity measures, clustering algorithms and parameters. Finally, we validated the biological relevance of co-expression cluster memberships with an independent phenomics dataset and found that genes that consistently cluster with leucine degradation genes tend to have similar leucine levels in mutants. This study provides a framework for obtaining gene functional associations by maximizing the information that can be obtained from gene expression datasets.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZbwqtwkBRhw" width="1" />

            <p>by György Abrusán, Joseph A. Marsh</p>

The rapidly increasing amount of data on human genetic variation has resulted in a growing demand to identify pathogenic mutations computationally, as their experimental validation is currently beyond reach. Here we show that alpha helices and beta strands differ significantly in their ability to tolerate mutations: helices can accumulate more mutations than strands without change, due to the higher numbers of inter-residue contacts in helices. This results in two patterns: a) the same number of mutations causes less structural change in helices than in strands; b) helices diverge more rapidly in sequence than strands within the same domains. Additionally, both helices and strands are significantly more robust than coils. Based on this observation we show that human missense mutations that change secondary structure are more likely to be pathogenic than those that do not. Moreover, inclusion of predicted secondary structure changes shows significant utility for improving upon state-of-the-art pathogenicity predictions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MYoa6ooP58U" width="1" />

            <p>by James W. Baish, Christian Kunert, Timothy P. Padera, Lance L. Munn</p>

The lymphatic system is responsible for transporting interstitial fluid back to the bloodstream, but unlike the cardiovascular system, lacks a centralized pump-the heart–to drive flow. Instead, each collecting lymphatic vessel can individually contract and dilate producing unidirectional flow enforced by intraluminal check valves. Due to the large number and spatial distribution of such pumps, high-level coordination would be unwieldy. This leads to the question of how each segment of lymphatic vessel responds to local signals that can contribute to the coordination of pumping on a network basis. Beginning with elementary fluid mechanics and known cellular behaviors, we show that two complementary oscillators emerge from i) mechanical stretch with calcium ion transport and ii) fluid shear stress induced nitric oxide production (NO). Using numerical simulation and linear stability analysis we show that the newly identified shear-NO oscillator shares similarities with the well-known Van der Pol oscillator, but has unique characteristics. Depending on the operating conditions, the shear-NO process may i) be inherently stable, ii) oscillate spontaneously in response to random disturbances or iii) synchronize with weak periodic stimuli. When the complementary shear-driven and stretch-driven oscillators interact, either may dominate, producing a rich family of behaviors similar to those observed <i>in vivo</i>.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aSsYRYXjfzI" width="1" />

            <p>by Debashis Barik, David A. Ball, Jean Peccoud, John J. Tyson</p>

The cell division cycle of eukaryotes is governed by a complex network of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) and auxiliary proteins that govern CDK activities. The control system must function reliably in the context of molecular noise that is inevitable in tiny yeast cells, because mistakes in sequencing cell cycle events are detrimental or fatal to the cell or its progeny. To assess the effects of noise on cell cycle progression requires not only extensive, quantitative, experimental measurements of cellular heterogeneity but also comprehensive, accurate, mathematical models of stochastic fluctuations in the CDK control system. In this paper we provide a stochastic model of the budding yeast cell cycle that accurately accounts for the variable phenotypes of wild-type cells and more than 20 mutant yeast strains simulated in different growth conditions. We specifically tested the role of feedback regulations mediated by G1- and SG2M-phase cyclins to minimize the noise in cell cycle progression. Details of the model are informed and tested by quantitative measurements (by fluorescence in situ hybridization) of the joint distributions of mRNA populations in yeast cells. We use the model to predict the phenotypes of ~30 mutant yeast strains that have not yet been characterized experimentally.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jm3qWZ1bTrs" width="1" />

            <p>by Marcin Zagorski, Zdzislaw Burda, Bartlomiej Waclaw</p>

Evolutionary pathways describe trajectories of biological evolution in the space of different variants of organisms (genotypes). The probability of existence and the number of evolutionary pathways that lead from a given genotype to a better-adapted genotype are important measures of accessibility of local fitness optima and the reproducibility of evolution. Both quantities have been studied in simple mathematical models where genotypes are represented as binary sequences of two types of basic units, and the network of permitted mutations between the genotypes is a hypercube graph. However, it is unclear how these results translate to the biologically relevant case in which genotypes are represented by sequences of more than two units, for example four nucleotides (DNA) or 20 amino acids (proteins), and the mutational graph is not the hypercube. Here we investigate accessibility of the best-adapted genotype in the general case of <i>K</i> &gt; 2 units. Using computer generated and experimental fitness landscapes we show that accessibility of the global fitness maximum increases with <i>K</i> and can be much higher than for binary sequences. The increase in accessibility comes from the increase in the number of indirect trajectories exploited by evolution for higher <i>K</i>. As one of the consequences, the fraction of genotypes that are accessible increases by three orders of magnitude when the number of units <i>K</i> increases from 2 to 16 for landscapes of size <i>N</i> ∼ 10<sup>6</sup> genotypes. This suggests that evolution can follow many different trajectories on such landscapes and the reconstruction of evolutionary pathways from experimental data might be an extremely difficult task.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PibK_kDrSnA" width="1" />

            <p>by Benjamin R. Cowley, Matthew A. Smith, Adam Kohn, Byron M. Yu</p>

Dimensionality reduction has been applied in various brain areas to study the activity of populations of neurons. To interpret the outputs of dimensionality reduction, it is important to first understand its outputs for brain areas for which the relationship between the stimulus and neural response is well characterized. Here, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to trial-averaged neural responses in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) to study two fundamental, population-level questions. First, we characterized how neural complexity relates to stimulus complexity, where complexity is measured using relative comparisons of dimensionality. Second, we assessed the extent to which responses to different stimuli occupy similar dimensions of the population activity space using a novel statistical method. For comparison, we performed the same dimensionality reduction analyses on the activity of a recently-proposed V1 receptive field model and a deep convolutional neural network. Our results show that the dimensionality of the population response changes systematically with alterations in the properties and complexity of the visual stimulus.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lCDsiWfSDyE" width="1" />

            <p>Site-specific fluorescent labeling of proteins inside live mammalian cells has been achieved by employing Streptolysin O, a bacterial enzyme which forms temporary pores in the membrane and allows delivery of virtually any fluorescent probes, ranging from labeled IgG’s to small ligands, with high efficiency (&gt;85% of cells). The whole process, including recovery, takes 30 min, and the cell is ready to be imaged immediately. A variety of cell viability tests were performed after treatment with SLO to ensure that the cells have intact membranes, are able to divide, respond normally to signaling molecules, and maintains healthy organelle morphology. When combined with Oxyrase, a cell-friendly photostabilizer, a ~20x improvement in fluorescence photostability is achieved. By adding in glutathione, fluorophores are made to blink, enabling super-resolution fluorescence with 20–30 nm resolution over a long time (~30 min) under continuous illumination. Example applications in conventional and super-resolution imaging of native and transfected cells include p65 signal transduction activation, single molecule tracking of kinesin, and specific labeling of a series of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein complexes.</p>

            <p>Activity-regulated genes (ARGs) are important for neuronal functions like long-term memory and are well-characterized in mammals but poorly studied in other model organisms like <em>Drosophila</em>. Here we stimulated fly neurons with different paradigms and identified ARGs using high-throughput sequencing from brains as well as from sorted neurons: they included a narrow set of circadian neurons as well as dopaminergic neurons. Surprisingly, many ARGs are specific to the stimulation paradigm and very specific to neuron type. In addition and unlike mammalian immediate early genes (IEGs), fly ARGs do not have short gene lengths and are less enriched for transcription factor function. Chromatin assays using ATAC-sequencing show that the transcription start sites (TSS) of ARGs do not change with neural firing but are already accessible prior to stimulation. Lastly based on binding site enrichment in ARGs, we identified transcription factor mediators of firing and created neuronal activity reporters.</p>

            Individual differences in brain organization exist at many spatial and temporal scales, contributing to the substantial heterogeneity underlying human thought and behavior. Oscillatory neural activity is crucial for these behaviors, but how such rhythms are expressed across the cortex within and across individuals has not been thoroughly characterized. Combining electroencephalography (EEG) with representational similarity and multivariate classification techniques, we provide a systematic characterization of brain-wide activity across frequency bands and oscillatory features during rest and task performance. Results indicate that oscillatory profiles exhibit sizable group-level correspondences, indicating the presence of common templates of oscillatory organization. At the same time, we observed well-defined subject-specific network profiles that were discernible above and beyond the structure shared across individuals. These individualized patterns were sufficiently stable over time to allow successful classification of individuals several months later. Finally, our findings indicate that the network structure of rhythmic activity varies considerably across distinct oscillatory frequencies and features, suggesting the existence of multiple, parallel information processing streams embedded in distributed electrophysiological activity. Together, these findings affirm the richness of spatiotemporal EEG signals and emphasize the utility of multivariate network analyses for understanding the role of brain oscillations in physiology and behavior.

            The superior colliculus (SC) is an integrative sensorimotor structure that contributes to multiple vision- dependent behaviors. It is a laminated structure; the superficial SC layers (sSC) contain cells that respond to visual stimuli, while the deep SC layers (dSC) contain cells that also respond to auditory and somatosensory stimuli. Despite the increasing interest in mice for visual system study, the differences in the visual response properties between the sSC and the dSC are largely unknown. Here we used a large-scale silicon probe recording system to examine the visual response properties of neurons within the SC of head-fixed, awake and behaving mice. We find that both the sSC and dSC cells respond to visual stimuli, but dSC cells have three key differences. (1) The majority of the dSC orientation/direction selective (OS/DS) cells have their firing rate suppressed by drifting sinusoidal gratings (negative OS/DS cells) rather than being stimulated like the sSC cells (positive OS/DS cells). (2) Almost all the dSC cells have complex-cell-like spatial summation nonlinearity, and a significantly smaller fraction of the positive OS/DS cells in the dSC respond to flashing spots than those in the sSC. (3) The dSC cells lack Y-like spatial summation nonlinearity unlike the sSC cells. These results provide the first description of cells that are suppressed by a visual stimulus with a specific orientation or direction, show that neurons in the dSC have properties analogous to cortical complex cells, and show the presence of Y-like nonlinearity in the sSC but their absence in the dSC.

            The principle of maximum entropy provides a useful method for inferring statistical mechanics models from observations in correlated systems, and is widely used in a variety of fields where accurate data are available. While the assumptions underlying maximum entropy are intuitive and appealing, its adequacy for describing complex empirical data has been little studied in comparison to alternative approaches. Here data from the collective spiking activity of retinal neurons is reanalysed. The accuracy of the maximum entropy distribution constrained by mean firing rates and pairwise correlations is compared to a random ensemble of distributions constrained by the same observables. In general, maximum entropy approximates the true distribution better than the typical or mean distribution from that ensemble. This advantage improves with population size, with groups as small as 8 being almost always better described by maximum entropy. Failure of maximum entropy to outperform random models is found to be associated with strong correlations in the population.

            The storage and persistence of memories depends on plasticity in the hippocampus. Adult neurogenesis produces new neurons that mature through critical periods for plasticity and cellular survival, which determine their contributions to learning and memory. However, most neurons are generated in early postnatal development; the maturational timecourse of these neurons is poorly understood compared to adult-born neurons, but is essential to identify how the dentate gyrus, as a whole, contributes to behavior. To characterize the survival and maturational timecourse of dentate gyrus neurons born in the early postnatal period, we labeled neurons born on postnatal day 6 (P6) with BrdU and quantified maturation and survival across early (1 hour to 8 weeks old) and late (2-6 months old) cell ages. We find that the dynamics of developmentally-born neuron survival is essentially the opposite what has been published for neurons born in adulthood: P6-born neurons did not go through a period of cell death during their immature stages (from 1-8w). In contrast, 17% of P6-born neurons died after reaching maturity, between 2-6 months of age. Delayed death was evident from the loss of BrdU+ cells as well as pyknotic caspase3+ neurons within the superficial granule cell layer. Patterns of DCX, NeuN and activity-dependent Fos expression indicate that developmentally-born neurons mature over several weeks and a sharp peak in zif268 expression at 2 weeks suggests that developmentally-born neurons mature faster than adult-born neurons (previously been shown to peak at 3 weeks). Collectively, our findings are relevant for understanding how developmentally-born dentate gyrus neurons contribute to memory and disorders throughout the lifespan. High levels of early survival and zif268 expression may promote learning, while also rendering neurons sensitive to insults at defined stages. Late neuronal death in young adulthood may result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of dentate gyrus neurons, which could impact memory persistence and contribute to hippocampal/dentate gyrus atrophy in disorders such as depression.

            Neuronal activity generates ionic flows and thereby both magnetic fields and electric potential differences, i.e. voltages. Voltage measurements at (sub)cellular, meso- and macroscopic level constitute electrophysiology. However, each voltage recording suffers from the isolating and smearing properties of the tissue between source and sensor, is blind to ionic flow direction, and reflects the difference between two electrodes, complicating interpretation, specifically of signal correlations. Magnetic field measurements could overcome these limitations, but have been essentially limited to magnetoencephalography (MEG), using centimeter-sized, helium-cooled extracranial sensors. Here, we report on in-vivo magnetic recordings of neuronal activity in the visual cortex of cats with magnetrodes, specially developed needle-shaped probes carrying micron-sized, non-cooled magnetic sensors based on spin electronics. Event-related magnetic fields inside the neuropil were on the order of several nanoteslas, informing biophysically detailed neural network models, MEG source models and efforts to measure neuronal magnetic fields by other means, e.g. through MRI.

            <p>by Ekaterina O. Morozova, Denis Zakharov, Boris S. Gutkin, Christopher C. Lapish, Alexey Kuznetsov</p>

The dynamics of neuronal excitability determine the neuron’s response to stimuli, its synchronization and resonance properties and, ultimately, the computations it performs in the brain. We investigated the dynamical mechanisms underlying the excitability type of dopamine (DA) neurons, using a conductance-based biophysical model, and its regulation by intrinsic and synaptic currents. Calibrating the model to reproduce low frequency tonic firing results in <i>N</i>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) excitation balanced by γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition and leads to type I excitable behavior characterized by a continuous decrease in firing frequency in response to hyperpolarizing currents. Furthermore, we analyzed how excitability type of the DA neuron model is influenced by changes in the intrinsic current composition. A subthreshold sodium current is necessary for a continuous frequency decrease during application of a negative current, and the low-frequency “balanced” state during simultaneous activation of NMDA and GABA receptors. Blocking this current switches the neuron to type II characterized by the abrupt onset of repetitive firing. Enhancing the anomalous rectifier Ih current also switches the excitability to type II. Key characteristics of synaptic conductances that may be observed in vivo also change the type of excitability: a depolarized γ-Aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAR) reversal potential or co-activation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) leads to an abrupt frequency drop to zero, which is typical for type II excitability. Coactivation of <i>N</i>-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) together with AMPARs and GABARs shifts the type I/II boundary toward more hyperpolarized GABAR reversal potentials. To better understand how altering each of the aforementioned currents leads to changes in excitability profile of DA neuron, we provide a thorough dynamical analysis. Collectively, these results imply that type I excitability in dopamine neurons might be important for low firing rates and fine-tuning basal dopamine levels, while switching excitability to type II during NMDAR and AMPAR activation may facilitate a transient increase in dopamine concentration, as type II neurons are more amenable to synchronization by mutual excitation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mlJT1H0Cmmo" width="1" />

We present StochSS: Stochastic Simulation as a Service, an integrated development environment for modeling and simulation of both deterministic and discrete stochastic biochemical systems in up to three dimensions. An easy to use graphical user interface enables researchers to quickly develop and simulate a biological model on a desktop or laptop, which can then be expanded to incorporate increasing levels of complexity. StochSS features state-of-the-art simulation engines. As the demand for computational power increases, StochSS can seamlessly scale computing resources in the cloud. In addition, StochSS can be deployed as a multi-user software environment where collaborators share computational resources and exchange models via a public model repository. We demonstrate the capabilities and ease of use of StochSS with an example of model development and simulation at increasing levels of complexity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-vkxBeSlnwU" width="1" />

            <p>by Jantien A. Backer, Jacco Wallinga</p>

In 2014–2016, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in West Africa experienced the largest and longest Ebola epidemic since the discovery of the virus in 1976. During the epidemic, incidence data were collected and published at increasing resolution. To monitor the epidemic as it spread within and between districts, we develop an analysis method that exploits the full spatiotemporal resolution of the data by combining a local model for time-varying effective reproduction numbers with a gravity-type model for spatial dispersion of the infection. We test this method in simulations and apply it to the weekly incidences of confirmed and probable cases per district up to June 2015, as reported by the World Health Organization. Our results indicate that, of the newly infected cases, only a small percentage, between 4% and 10%, migrates to another district, and a minority of these migrants, between 0% and 23%, leave their country. The epidemics in the three countries are found to be similar in estimated effective reproduction numbers, and in the probability of importing infection into a district. The countries might have played different roles in cross-border transmissions, although a sensitivity analysis suggests that this could also be related to underreporting. The spatiotemporal analysis method can exploit available longitudinal incidence data at different geographical locations to monitor local epidemics, determine the extent of spatial spread, reveal the contribution of local and imported cases, and identify sources of introductions in uninfected areas. With good quality data on incidence, this data-driven method can help to effectively control emerging infections.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MajqXj4ZY8I" width="1" />

            <p>Spatial clustering of ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) through tertiary interactions is a striking structural feature of the eukaryotic ribosome. However, the functional importance of these intricate inter-connections, and how they are established is currently unclear. Here, we reveal that a conserved ATPase, Fap7, organizes interactions between neighboring r-proteins uS11 and eS26 prior to their delivery to the earliest ribosome precursor, the 90S. In vitro, uS11 only when bound to Fap7 becomes competent to recruit eS26 through tertiary contacts found between these r-proteins on the mature ribosome. Subsequently, Fap7 ATPase activity unloads the uS11:eS26 subcomplex onto its rRNA binding site, and therefore ensures stoichiometric integration of these r-proteins into the 90S. Fap7-depletion in vivo renders uS11 susceptible to proteolysis, and precludes eS26 incorporation into the 90S. Thus, prefabrication of a native-like r-protein subcomplex drives efficient and accurate construction of the eukaryotic ribosome.</p>

Genetic studies have found that a common polymorphic variant in ANGPTL4 results in lower plasma triglyceride levels. We now report: (1) that this ANGPTL4 variant is less efficient in catalyzing the unfolding of LPL; and (2) that its Glu-to-Lys substitution destabilizes its N-terminal α-helix. Our work elucidates the molecular basis for regulation of LPL activity by ANGPTL4, highlights the physiological relevance of the inherent instability of LPL, and sheds light on the molecular defects in a clinically relevant variant of ANGPTL4.</p>

            The impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) involves a combination of complex biochemical processes beginning with the initial insult and lasting for days, months and even years post-trauma. These changes range from neuronal integrity losses to neurotransmitter imbalance and metabolite dysregulation, leading to the release of pro- or anti-apoptotic factors which mediate cell survival or death. Such dynamic processes affecting the brain's neurochemistry can be monitored using a variety of neuroimaging techniques, whose combined use can be particularly useful for understanding patient-specific clinical trajectories.

            Hierarchical feedforward processing makes object identity explicit at the highest stages of the ventral visual stream. We leveraged this computational goal to study the fine-scale temporal dynamics of neural populations in posterior and anterior inferior temporal cortex (pIT, aIT) during face detection. As expected, we found that a neural spiking preference for natural over distorted face images was rapidly produced, first in pIT and then in aIT. Strikingly, in the next 30 milliseconds of processing, this pattern of selectivity in pIT completely reversed, while selectivity in aIT remained unchanged. Although these dynamics were difficult to explain from a pure feedforward perspective, a model class computing errors through feedback closely matched the observed neural dynamics and parsimoniously explained a range of seemingly disparate IT neural response phenomena. This new perspective augments the standard model of online vision by suggesting that neural signals of states (e.g. likelihood of a face being present) are intermixed with the error signals found in deep hierarchical networks.

            Much of economics, psychology and neuroscience have focused on thought dynamics and how they control our behavior, from individual moral choices to the irrationality of market dynamics. However, how much of our thoughts we actually control when we feel we make deliberate choices remains unknown. Here we show that the content of thoughts can be decoded from activity patterns as early as 11 seconds before individuals report having formed the volitional thought. Participants freely chose which of two differently oriented and colored gratings to think about. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and pattern classification methods, we consistently classified the contents of thoughts using activity patterns recorded before and after the thought was reported. We found that activity patterns were predictive as far as 11 seconds before the conscious thought, in visual, frontal and subcortical areas. These predictive patterns contained similar information to the responses evoked by unattended perceptual gratings and were evident in individual visual areas. Interestingly, neural information present before the decision was associated with the vividness of future thoughts, suggesting that preceding nonconscious sensory-like representations can impact the content and strength of future conscious thoughts. Our results suggest that thoughts and their strength can be biased by prior spontaneous nonconscious perception-like representations, advancing theories of free will and models of intrusive and repetitive thought production.

            <p>by Ryan C. Williamson, Benjamin R. Cowley, Ashok Litwin-Kumar, Brent Doiron, Adam Kohn, Matthew A. Smith, Byron M. Yu</p>

Recent studies have applied dimensionality reduction methods to understand how the multi-dimensional structure of neural population activity gives rise to brain function. It is unclear, however, how the results obtained from dimensionality reduction generalize to recordings with larger numbers of neurons and trials or how these results relate to the underlying network structure. We address these questions by applying factor analysis to recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates and to spiking network models that self-generate irregular activity through a balance of excitation and inhibition. We compared the scaling trends of two key outputs of dimensionality reduction—shared dimensionality and percent shared variance—with neuron and trial count. We found that the scaling properties of networks with non-clustered and clustered connectivity differed, and that the <i>in vivo</i> recordings were more consistent with the clustered network. Furthermore, recordings from tens of neurons were sufficient to identify the dominant modes of shared variability that generalize to larger portions of the network. These findings can help guide the interpretation of dimensionality reduction outputs in regimes of limited neuron and trial sampling and help relate these outputs to the underlying network structure.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3OebvFR-8r0" width="1" />

            <p>Aging compromises the frontal, striatal, and medial temporal areas of the reward system, impeding accurate value representation and feedback processing critical for decision making. However, substantial variability characterizes age-related effects on the brain so that some older individuals evince clear neurocognitive declines whereas others are spared. Moreover, the functional correlates of normative individual differences in older-adult value-based decision making remain unclear. We performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in 173 human older adults during a lottery choice task in which costly to more desirable stakes were depicted using low to high expected values (EVs) of points. Across trials that varied in EVs, participants decided to accept or decline the offered stakes to maximize total accumulated points. We found that greater age was associated with less optimal decisions, accepting stakes when losses were likely and declining stakes when gains were likely, and was associated with increased frontal activity for costlier stakes. Critically, risk preferences varied substantially across older adults and neural sensitivity to EVs in the frontal, striatal, and medial temporal areas dissociated risk-aversive from risk-taking individuals. Specifically, risk-averters increased neural responses to increasing EVs as stakes became more desirable, whereas risk-takers increased neural responses with decreasing EV as stakes became more costly. Risk preference also modulated striatal responses during feedback with risk-takers showing more positive responses to gains compared with risk-averters. Our findings highlight the frontal, striatal, and medial temporal areas as key neural loci in which individual differences differentially affect value-based decision-making ability in older adults.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Frontal, striatal, and medial temporal functions implicated in value-based decision processing of rewards and costs undergo substantial age-related changes. However, age effects on brain function and cognition differ across individuals. How this normative variation relates to older-adult value-based decision making is unclear. We found that although the ability make optimal decisions declines with age, there is still much individual variability in how this deterioration occurs. Critically, whereas risk-averters showed increased neural activity to increasingly valuable stakes in frontal, striatal, and medial temporal areas, risk-takers instead increased activity as stakes became more costly. Such distinct functional decision-making processing in these brain regions across normative older adults may reflect individual differences in susceptibility to age-related brain changes associated with incipient cognitive impairment.</p>

            <p>Decreased clearance of α-synuclein (aSyn) and aSyn protein misfolding and aggregation are seen as major factors in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies that leads to disruption in neuronal function and eventually to cell death. Prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) can accelerate the aSyn aggregation process, while inhibition of PREP by a small molecule inhibitor decreases aSyn oligomer formation and enhances its clearance via autophagy in different aSyn overexpressing cell types and in transgenic PD animal models. In this study, we investigated the impact of chronic PREP inhibition by a small molecule inhibitor, 4-phenylbutanoyl-l-prolyl-2(<i>S</i>)-cyanopyrrolidine (KYP-2047), on aSyn oligomerization, clearance, and underlying spontaneous motor behavior in a virus vector–based aSyn overexpression mouse model 4 weeks after aSyn microinjections and after the onset of symptomatic forepaw bias. Following 4 weeks of PREP inhibition, we saw an improved spontaneous forelimb use in mice that correlated with a decreased immunoreactivity against oligomer-specific forms of aSyn. Additionally, KYP-2047 had a trend to enhance dopaminergic systems activity. Our results suggest that PREP inhibition exhibits a beneficial effect on the aSyn clearance and aggregation in a virus mediated aSyn overexpression PD mouse model and that PREP inhibitors could be a novel therapeutic strategy for synucleinopathies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) has been implicated in Parkinson's disease, with aSyn aggregates believed to exert toxic effects on neurons, while prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) has been shown to interact with aSyn both in cells and cell free conditions, thus enhancing its aggregation. We demonstrate the possibility to abolish motor imbalance caused by aSyn viral vector injection with chronic 4 week PREP inhibition by a potent small-molecule PREP inhibitor, 4-phenylbutanoyl-l-prolyl-2(<i>S</i>)-cyanopyrrolidine (KYP-2047). Treatment was initiated postsymptomatically, 4 weeks after aSyn injection. KYP-2047-treated animals had a significantly decreased amount of oligomeric aSyn particles and improved dopamine system activity compared to control animals. To our knowledge, this is the first time viral overexpression of aSyn has been countered and movement impairments abolished after their onset.</p>

            <p>Despite the success of cochlear implants (CIs) in human populations, most users perform poorly in noisy environments and music and tonal language perception. How CI devices engage the brain at the single neuron level has remained largely unknown, in particular in the primate brain. By comparing neuronal responses with acoustic and CI stimulation in marmoset monkeys unilaterally implanted with a CI electrode array, we discovered that CI stimulation was surprisingly ineffective at activating many neurons in auditory cortex, particularly in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the CI. Further analyses revealed that the CI-nonresponsive neurons were narrowly tuned to frequency and sound level when probed with acoustic stimuli; such neurons likely play a role in perceptual behaviors requiring fine frequency and level discrimination, tasks that CI users find especially challenging. These findings suggest potential deficits in central auditory processing of CI stimulation and provide important insights into factors responsible for poor CI user performance in a wide range of perceptual tasks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cochlear implant (CI) is the most successful neural prosthetic device to date and has restored hearing in hundreds of thousands of deaf individuals worldwide. However, despite its huge successes, CI users still face many perceptual limitations, and the brain mechanisms involved in hearing through CI devices remain poorly understood. By directly comparing single-neuron responses to acoustic and CI stimulation in auditory cortex of awake marmoset monkeys, we discovered that neurons unresponsive to CI stimulation were sharply tuned to frequency and sound level. Our results point out a major deficit in central auditory processing of CI stimulation and provide important insights into mechanisms underlying the poor CI user performance in a wide range of perceptual tasks.</p>

            <p>The need to breathe links the mammalian olfactory system inextricably to the respiratory rhythms that draw air through the nose. In rodents and other small animals, slow oscillations of local field potential activity are driven at the rate of breathing (~2–12 Hz) in olfactory bulb and cortex, and faster oscillatory bursts are coupled to specific phases of the respiratory cycle. These dynamic rhythms are thought to regulate cortical excitability and coordinate network interactions, helping to shape olfactory coding, memory, and behavior. However, while respiratory oscillations are a ubiquitous hallmark of olfactory system function in animals, direct evidence for such patterns is lacking in humans. In this study, we acquired intracranial EEG data from rare patients (Ps) with medically refractory epilepsy, enabling us to test the hypothesis that cortical oscillatory activity would be entrained to the human respiratory cycle, albeit at the much slower rhythm of ~0.16–0.33 Hz. Our results reveal that natural breathing synchronizes electrical activity in human piriform (olfactory) cortex, as well as in limbic-related brain areas, including amygdala and hippocampus. Notably, oscillatory power peaked during inspiration and dissipated when breathing was diverted from nose to mouth. Parallel behavioral experiments showed that breathing phase enhances fear discrimination and memory retrieval. Our findings provide a unique framework for understanding the pivotal role of nasal breathing in coordinating neuronal oscillations to support stimulus processing and behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Animal studies have long shown that olfactory oscillatory activity emerges in line with the natural rhythm of breathing, even in the absence of an odor stimulus. Whether the breathing cycle induces cortical oscillations in the human brain is poorly understood. In this study, we collected intracranial EEG data from rare patients with medically intractable epilepsy, and found evidence for respiratory entrainment of local field potential activity in human piriform cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. These effects diminished when breathing was diverted to the mouth, highlighting the importance of nasal airflow for generating respiratory oscillations. Finally, behavioral data in healthy subjects suggest that breathing phase systematically influences cognitive tasks related to amygdala and hippocampal functions.</p>

            <p>During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, cortical neurons alternate between ON periods of firing and OFF periods of silence. This bi-stability, which is largely synchronous across neurons, is reflected in the EEG as slow waves. Slow-wave activity (SWA) increases with wake duration and declines homeostatically during sleep, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One possibility is neuronal "fatigue": high, sustained firing in wake would force neurons to recover with more frequent and longer OFF periods during sleep. Another possibility is net synaptic potentiation during wake: stronger coupling among neurons would lead to greater synchrony and therefore higher SWA. Here, we obtained a comparable increase in sustained firing (6 h) in cortex by: (1) keeping mice awake by exposure to novel objects to promote plasticity and (2) optogenetically activating a local population of cortical neurons at wake-like levels during sleep. Sleep after extended wake led to increased SWA, higher synchrony, and more time spent OFF, with a positive correlation between SWA, synchrony, and OFF periods. Moreover, time spent OFF was correlated with cortical firing during prior wake. After local optogenetic stimulation, SWA and cortical synchrony decreased locally, time spent OFF did not change, and local SWA was not correlated with either measure. Moreover, laser-induced cortical firing was not correlated with time spent OFF afterward. Overall, these results suggest that high sustained firing per se may not be the primary determinant of SWA increases observed after extended wake.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A long-standing hypothesis is that neurons fire less during slow-wave sleep to recover from the "fatigue" accrued during wake, when overall synaptic activity is higher than in sleep. This idea, however, has rarely been tested and other factors, namely increased cortical synchrony, could explain why sleep slow-wave activity (SWA) is higher after extended wake. We forced neurons in the mouse cortex to fire at high levels for 6 h in 2 different conditions: during active wake with exploration and during sleep. We find that neurons need more time OFF only after sustained firing in wake, suggesting that fatigue due to sustained firing alone is unlikely to account for the increase in SWA that follows sleep deprivation.</p>

            <p>Passive immunization with anti-tau monoclonal antibodies has been shown by several laboratories to reduce age-dependent tau pathology and neurodegeneration in mutant tau transgenic mice. These studies have used repeated high weekly doses of various tau antibodies administered systemically for several months and have reported reduced tau pathology of ~40–50% in various brain regions. Here we show that direct intrahippocampal administration of the adeno-associated virus (AAV)-vectored anti-phospho-tau antibody PHF1 to P301S tau transgenic mice results in high and durable antibody expression, primarily in neurons. Hippocampal antibody levels achieved after AAV delivery were ~50-fold more than those reported following repeated systemic administration. In contrast to systemic passive immunization, we observed markedly reduced (≥80–90%) hippocampal insoluble pathological tau species and neurofibrillary tangles following a single dose of AAV-vectored PHF1 compared with mice treated with an AAV-IgG control vector. Moreover, the hippocampal atrophy observed in untreated P301S mice was fully rescued by treatment with the AAV-vectored PHF1 antibody. Vectored passive immunotherapy with an anti-tau monoclonal antibody may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for treating or preventing such tauopathies as frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, or Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We have used an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector to deliver the genes encoding an anti-phospho-tau monoclonal antibody, PHF1, directly to the brain of mice that develop neurodegeneration due to a tau mutation that causes frontotemporal dementia (FTD). When administered systemically, PHF1 has been shown to modestly reduce tau pathology and neurodegeneration. Since such antibodies do not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, we used an AAV vector to deliver antibody directly to the hippocampus and observed much higher antibody levels and a much greater reduction in tau pathology. Using AAV vectors to deliver antibodies like PHF1 directly to brain may constitute a novel approach to treating various neurodegenerative disorders, such as FTD and Alzheimer's disease.</p>

            <p>Narratives may provide a general context, unrestricted by space and time, which can be used to organize episodic memories into networks of related events. However, it is not clear how narrative contexts are represented in the brain. Here we test the novel hypothesis that the formation of narrative-based contextual representations in humans relies on the same hippocampal mechanisms that enable formation of spatiotemporal contexts in rodents. Participants watched a movie consisting of two interleaved narratives while we monitored their brain activity using fMRI. We used representational similarity analysis, a type of multivariate pattern analysis, which uses across-voxel correlations as a proxy for neural-pattern similarity, to examine whether the patterns of neural activity can be used to differentiate between narratives and recurring narrative elements, such as people and locations. We demonstrate that the neural activity patterns in the hippocampus differentiate between event nodes (people and locations) and narratives (different stories) and that these narrative-context representations diverge gradually over time akin to remapping-induced spatial maps represented by rodent place cells.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Narratives, especially in movie format, are very engaging and can be used to investigate neural mechanisms underlying cognitive functions in more naturalistic settings than that of traditional paradigms. Narratives also provide a more general context, unrestricted by space and time, that can be used to organize memories into networks of related events. For this reason, narratives are ideally suited to engage neural mechanisms underlying episodic memory formation. In this study, participants watched a movie with two interleaved narratives while their brain activity was monitored using fMRI. We show that the hippocampus, which is involved in formation of spatiotemporal contexts in episodic memory, also represents gradually diverging narrative contexts as well as narrative elements, such as people and locations.</p>

            <p>Proteome modifications downstream of monogenic or polygenic disorders have the potential to uncover novel molecular mechanisms participating in pathogenesis and/or extragenic modification of phenotypic expression. We tested this idea by determining the proteome sensitive to genetic defects in a locus encoding dysbindin, a protein required for synapse biology and implicated in schizophrenia risk. We applied quantitative mass spectrometry to identify proteins expressed in neuronal cells the abundance of which was altered after downregulation of the schizophrenia susceptibility factor dysbindin (Bloc1s8) or two other dysbindin-interacting polypeptides, which assemble into the octameric biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1). We found 491 proteins sensitive to dysbindin and BLOC-1 loss of function. Gene ontology of these 491 proteins singled out the actin cytoskeleton and the actin polymerization factor, the Arp2/3 complex, as top statistical molecular pathways contained within the BLOC-1-sensitive proteome. Subunits of the Arp2/3 complex were downregulated by BLOC-1 loss of function, thus affecting actin dynamics in early endosomes of BLOC-1-deficient cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Arp2/3, dysbindin, and subunits of the BLOC-1 complex biochemically and genetically interact, modulating <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> synapse morphology and homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Our results indicate that ontologically prioritized proteomics identifies novel pathways that modify synaptic phenotypes associated with neurodevelopmental disorder gene defects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The mechanisms associated with schizophrenia are mostly unknown despite the increasing number of genetic loci identified that increase disease risk. We present an experimental strategy that impartially and comprehensively interrogates the proteome of neurons to identify effects of genetic mutations in a schizophrenia risk factor, dysbindin. We find that the expression of the actin polymerization complex Arp2/3 is reduced in dysbindin-deficient cells, thus affecting actin-dependent phenotypes in two cellular compartments where dysbindin resides, endosomes and presynapses. Our studies indicate that a central cellular structure affected by schizophrenia susceptibility loci is the actin cytoskeleton, an organelle necessary for synaptic function in the presynaptic and postsynaptic compartment.</p>

            <p>Neuroimaging studies of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) suggest that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) region is responsive to a wide variety of stimuli and psychological states, such as pain, cognitive control, and prediction error (PE). In contrast, a recent meta-analysis argues that the dACC is selective for pain, whereas the supplementary motor area (SMA) and pre-SMA are specifically associated with higher-level cognitive processes (Lieberman and Eisenberger, 2015). To empirically test this claim, we manipulated effects of pain, conflict, and PE in a single experiment using human subjects. We observed a robust dorsal-ventral dissociation within the mPFC with cognitive effects of PE and conflict overlapping dorsally and pain localized more ventrally. Classification of subjects based on the presence or absence of a paracingulate sulcus showed that PE effects extended across the dorsal area of the dACC and into the pre-SMA. These results begin to resolve recent controversies by showing the following: (1) the mPFC includes dissociable regions for pain and cognitive processing; and (2) meta-analyses are correct in localizing cognitive effects to the dACC, although these effects extend to the pre-SMA as well. These results both provide evidence distinguishing between different theories of mPFC function and highlight the importance of taking individual anatomical variability into account when conducting empirical studies of the mPFC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Decades of neuroimaging research have shown the mPFC to represent a wide variety of stimulus processing and cognitive states. However, recently it has been argued whether distinct regions of the mPFC separately process pain and cognitive phenomena. To address this controversy, this study directly compared pain and cognitive processes within subjects. We found a double dissociation within the mPFC with pain localized ventral to the cingulate sulcus and cognitive effects localized more dorsally within the dACC and spreading into the pre-supplementary motor area. This provides empirical evidence to help resolve the current debate about the functional architecture of the mPFC.</p>

            <p>A new computational model of the primary visual cortex (V1) of the macaque monkey was constructed to reconcile the visual functions of V1 with anatomical data on its LGN input, the extreme sparseness of which presented serious challenges to theoretically sound explanations of cortical function. We demonstrate that, even with such sparse input, it is possible to produce robust orientation selectivity, as well as continuity in the orientation map. We went beyond that to find plausible dynamic regimes of our new model that emulate simultaneously experimental data for a wide range of V1 phenomena, beginning with orientation selectivity but also including diversity in neuronal responses, bimodal distributions of the modulation ratio (the simple/complex classification), and dynamic signatures, such as gamma-band oscillations. Intracortical interactions play a major role in all aspects of the visual functions of the model.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We present the first realistic model that has captured the sparseness of magnocellular LGN inputs to the macaque primary visual cortex and successfully derived orientation selectivity from them. Three implications are (1) even in input layers to the visual cortex, the system is less feedforward and more dominated by intracortical signals than previously thought, (2) interactions among cortical neurons in local populations produce dynamics not explained by single neurons, and (3) such dynamics are important for function. Our model also shows that a comprehensive picture is necessary to explain function, because different visual properties are related. This study points to the need for paradigm shifts in neuroscience modeling: greater emphasis on population dynamics and, where possible, a move toward data-driven, comprehensive models.</p>

            <p>Schwann cells (SCs) are essential for proper peripheral nerve development and repair, although the mechanisms regulating these processes are incompletely understood. We previously showed that the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor Gpr126/Adgrg6 is essential for SC development and myelination. Interestingly, the expression of Gpr126 is maintained in adult SCs, suggestive of a function in the mature nerve. We therefore investigated the role of Gpr126 in nerve repair by studying an inducible SC-specific <i>Gpr126</i> knock-out mouse model. Here, we show that remyelination is severely delayed after nerve-crush injury. Moreover, we also observe noncell-autonomous defects in macrophage recruitment and axon regeneration in injured nerves following loss of Gpr126 in SCs. This work demonstrates that Gpr126 has critical SC-autonomous and SC-nonautonomous functions in remyelination and peripheral nerve repair.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Lack of robust remyelination represents one of the major barriers to recovery of neurological functions in disease or following injury in many disorders of the nervous system. Here we show that the adhesion class G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Gpr126/Adgrg6 is required for remyelination, macrophage recruitment, and axon regeneration following nerve injury. At least 30% of all approved drugs target GPCRs; thus, Gpr126 represents an attractive potential target to stimulate repair in myelin disease or following nerve injury.</p>

            <p>A primary goal of auditory neuroscience is to identify the sound features extracted and represented by auditory neurons. Linear encoding models, which describe neural responses as a function of the stimulus, have been primarily used for this purpose. Here, we provide theoretical arguments and experimental evidence in support of an alternative approach, based on decoding the stimulus from the neural response. We used a Bayesian normative approach to predict the responses of neurons detecting relevant auditory features, despite ambiguities and noise. We compared the model predictions to recordings from the primary auditory cortex of ferrets and found that: (1) the decoding filters of auditory neurons resemble the filters learned from the statistics of speech sounds; (2) the decoding model captures the dynamics of responses better than a linear encoding model of similar complexity; and (3) the decoding model accounts for the accuracy with which the stimulus is represented in neural activity, whereas linear encoding model performs very poorly. Most importantly, our model predicts that neuronal responses are fundamentally shaped by "explaining away," a divisive competition between alternative interpretations of the auditory scene.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neural responses in the auditory cortex are dynamic, nonlinear, and hard to predict. Traditionally, encoding models have been used to describe neural responses as a function of the stimulus. However, in addition to external stimulation, neural activity is strongly modulated by the responses of other neurons in the network. We hypothesized that auditory neurons aim to collectively decode their stimulus. In particular, a stimulus feature that is decoded (or explained away) by one neuron is not explained by another. We demonstrated that this novel Bayesian decoding model is better at capturing the dynamic responses of cortical neurons in ferrets. Whereas the linear encoding model poorly reflects selectivity of neurons, the decoding model can account for the strong nonlinearities observed in neural data.</p>

            <p>A fundamental task of the visual system is to extract figure–ground boundaries between objects, which are often defined, not only by differences in luminance, but also by "second-order" contrast or texture differences. Responses of cortical neurons to both first- and second-order patterns have been studied extensively, but only for responses to either type of stimulus in isolation. Here, we examined responses of visual cortex neurons to the spatial relationship between superimposed periodic luminance modulation (LM) and contrast modulation (CM) stimuli, the contrasts of which were adjusted to give equated responses when presented alone. Extracellular single-unit recordings were made in area 18 of the cat, the neurons of which show responses to CM and LM stimuli very similar to those in primate area V2 (Li et al., 2014). Most neurons showed a significant dependence on the relative phase of the combined LM and CM patterns, with a clear overall optimal response when they were approximately phase aligned. The degree of this phase preference, and the contributions of suppressive and/or facilitatory interactions, varied considerably from one neuron to another. Such phase-dependent and phase-invariant responses were evident in both simple- and complex-type cells. These results place important constraints on any future model of the underlying neural circuitry for second-order responses. The diversity in the degree of phase dependence between LM and CM stimuli that we observed could help to disambiguate different kinds of boundaries in natural scenes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many visual cortex neurons exhibit orientation-selective responses to boundaries defined by differences either in luminance or in texture contrast. Previous studies have examined responses to either type of boundary in isolation, but here we measured systematically responses of cortical neurons to the spatial relationship between superimposed periodic luminance-modulated (LM) and contrast-modulated (CM) stimuli with contrasts adjusted to give equated responses. We demonstrate that neuronal responses to these compound stimuli are highly dependent on the relative phase between the LM and CM components. Diversity in the degree of such phase dependence could help to disambiguate different kinds of boundaries in natural scenes, for example, those arising from surface reflectance changes or from illumination gradients such as shading or shadows.</p>

            <p>Lateral inhibition between pairs of olfactory bulb (OB) mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs) is linked to a variety of computations including gain control, decorrelation, and gamma-frequency synchronization. Differential effects of lateral inhibition onto MCs and TCs via distinct lateral inhibitory circuits are one of several recently described circuit-level differences between MCs and TCs that allow each to encode separate olfactory features in parallel. Here, using acute OB slices from mice, we tested whether lateral inhibition is affected by prior odor exposure and if these effects differ between MCs and TCs. We found that early postnatal odor exposure to the M72 glomerulus ligand acetophenone increased the strength of interglomerular lateral inhibition onto TCs, but not MCs, when the M72 glomerulus was stimulated. These increases were specific to exposure to M72 ligands because exposure to hexanal did not increase the strength of M72-mediated lateral inhibition. Therefore, early life experiences may be an important factor shaping TC odor responses.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Responses of olfactory (OB) bulb mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs) are known to depend on prior odor exposure, yet the specific circuit mechanisms underlying these experience-dependent changes are unknown. Here, we show that odor exposure alters one particular circuit element, interglomerular lateral inhibition, which is known to be critical for a variety of OB computations. Early postnatal odor exposure to acetophenone, a ligand of M72 olfactory sensory neurons, increases the strength of M72-mediated lateral inhibition onto TCs, but not MCs, that project to nearby glomeruli. These findings add to a growing list of differences between MCs and TCs suggesting that that these two cell types play distinct roles in odor coding.</p>

            <p>Alpha-5 gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (α5-GABAARs) are located extrasynaptically, regulate neuronal excitability through tonic inhibition, and are fundamentally important for processes such as plasticity and learning. For example, pharmacological blockade of α5-GABAAR in mice with ischemic stroke improved recovery of function by normalizing exaggerated perilesional α5-GABAAR-dependent tonic inhibition. S44819 is a novel competitive selective antagonist of the α5-GABAAR at the GABA-binding site. Pharmacological modulation of α5-GABAAR-mediated tonic inhibition has never been investigated in the human brain. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test the effects of a single oral dose of 50 and 100 mg of S44819 on electromyographic (EMG) and electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of cortical excitability in 18 healthy young adults in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover phase I study. A dose of 100 mg, but not 50 mg, of S44819 decreased active motor threshold, the intensity needed to produce a motor evoked potential of 0.5 mV, and the amplitude of the N45, a GABAAergic component of the TMS-evoked EEG response. The peak serum concentration of 100 mg S44819 correlated directly with the decrease in N45 amplitude. Short-interval intracortical inhibition, a TMS–EMG measure of synaptic GABAAergic inhibition, and other components of the TMS-evoked EEG response remained unaffected. These findings provide first time evidence that the specific α5-GABAAR antagonist S44819 reached human cortex to impose an increase in cortical excitability. These data warrant further development of S44819 in a human clinical trial to test its efficacy in enhancing recovery of function after ischemic stroke.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The extrasynaptic α-5 gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (α5-GABAAR) regulates neuronal excitability through tonic inhibition in the mammalian brain. Tonic inhibition is important for many fundamental processes such as plasticity and learning. Pharmacological modulation of α5-GABAAR-mediated tonic inhibition has never been investigated in the human brain. This study demonstrates that S44819, a selective α5-GABAAR antagonist, increases cortical excitability in healthy human subjects, as indicated by specific markers of transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced muscle and brain responses measured by electromyography and electroencephalography. Our findings imply that tonic inhibition in human cortex can be modified effectively and that this modification can be quantified with noninvasive brain stimulation methods. The actions of S44819 may be suitable to improve plasticity and learning.</p>

            <p>Acoustic environments are composed of complex overlapping sounds that the auditory system is required to segregate into discrete perceptual objects. The functions of distinct auditory processing stations in this challenging task are poorly understood. Here we show a direct role for mouse auditory cortex in detection and segregation of acoustic information. We measured the sensitivity of auditory cortical neurons to brief tones embedded in masking noise. By altering spectrotemporal characteristics of the masker, we reveal that sensitivity to pure tone stimuli is strongly enhanced in coherently modulated broadband noise, corresponding to the psychoacoustic phenomenon comodulation masking release. Improvements in detection were largest following priming periods of noise alone, indicating that cortical segregation is enhanced over time. Transient opsin-mediated silencing of auditory cortex during the priming period almost completely abolished these improvements, suggesting that cortical processing may play a direct and significant role in detection of quiet sounds in noisy environments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Auditory systems are adept at detecting and segregating competing sound sources, but there is little direct evidence of how this process occurs in the mammalian auditory pathway. We demonstrate that coherent broadband noise enhances signal representation in auditory cortex, and that prolonged exposure to noise is necessary to produce this enhancement. Using optogenetic perturbation to selectively silence auditory cortex during early noise processing, we show that cortical processing plays a crucial role in the segregation of competing sounds.</p>

            <p>Cortical networks exhibit intrinsic dynamics that drive coordinated, large-scale fluctuations across neuronal populations and create noise correlations that impact sensory coding. To investigate the network-level mechanisms that underlie these dynamics, we developed novel computational techniques to fit a deterministic spiking network model directly to multi-neuron recordings from different rodent species, sensory modalities, and behavioral states. The model generated correlated variability without external noise and accurately reproduced the diverse activity patterns in our recordings. Analysis of the model parameters suggested that differences in noise correlations across recordings were due primarily to differences in the strength of feedback inhibition. Further analysis of our recordings confirmed that putative inhibitory neurons were indeed more active during desynchronized cortical states with weak noise correlations. Our results demonstrate that network models with intrinsically-generated variability can accurately reproduce the activity patterns observed in multi-neuron recordings and suggest that inhibition modulates the interactions between intrinsic dynamics and sensory inputs to control the strength of noise correlations.</p>

            Multivariate Pattern (MVP) classification can map different cognitive states to the brain tasks. One of the main challenges in MVP analysis is validating the generated results across subjects. However, analyzing multi-subject fMRI data requires accurate functional alignments between neuronal activities of different subjects, which can rapidly increase the performance and robustness of the final results. Hyperalignment (HA) is one of the most effective functional alignment methods, which can be mathematically formulated by the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) methods. Since HA mostly uses the unsupervised CCA techniques, its solution may not be optimized for MVP analysis. By incorporating the idea of Local Discriminant Analysis (LDA) into CCA, this paper proposes Local Discriminant Hyperalignment (LDHA) as a novel supervised HA method, which can provide better functional alignment for MVP analysis. Indeed, the locality is defined based on the stimuli categories in the train-set, where the correlation between all stimuli in the same category will be maximized and the correlation between distinct categories of stimuli approaches to near zero. Experimental studies on multi-subject MVP analysis confirm that the LDHA method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art HA algorithms.

            A universal unanswered question in neuroscience and machine learning is whether computers can decode the patterns of the human brain. Multi-Voxels Pattern Analysis (MVPA) is a critical tool for addressing this question. However, there are two challenges in the previous MVPA methods, which include decreasing sparsity and noises in the extracted features and increasing the performance of prediction. In overcoming mentioned challenges, this paper proposes Anatomical Pattern Analysis (APA) for decoding visual stimuli in the human brain. This framework develops a novel anatomical feature extraction method and a new imbalance AdaBoost algorithm for binary classification. Further, it utilizes an Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) method for multi-class prediction. APA can automatically detect active regions for each category of the visual stimuli. Moreover, it enables us to combine homogeneous datasets for applying advanced classification. Experimental studies on 4 visual categories (words, consonants, objects and scrambled photos) demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.

            We present a dataset combining electrophysiology and eye tracking intended as a resource for the investigation of information processing in the developing brain. The dataset includes high-density task-based and task-free EEG, eye tracking, and cognitive and behavioral data collected from 126 individuals (ages: 6-44). The task battery spans both the simple/complex and passive/active dimensions to cover a range of approaches prevalent in modern cognitive neuroscience. The active task paradigms facilitate principled deconstruction of core components of task performance in the developing brain, whereas the passive paradigms permit the examination of intrinsic functional network activity during varying amounts of external stimulation. Alongside these neurophysiological data, we include an abbreviated cognitive test battery and questionnaire-based measures of psychiatric functioning. We hope that this dataset will lead to the development of novel assays of neural processes fundamental to information processing, which can be used to index healthy brain development as well as detect pathologic processes.

            We resemble our friends on a wide range of dimensions (e.g., age, gender), but do similarities between friends reflect deeper similarities in how we perceive, interpret, and respond to the world? To find out, we characterized the social network of a cohort of 279 students, a subset of whom participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study involving free-viewing of video stimuli. We compared fMRI response time series between corresponding brain regions across pairs of individuals and found that neural response similarity decreased with increasing distance in the social network. These effects persisted after controlling for demographic similarity. Further, it was possible to accurately classify the distance between individuals in their social network based on the similarity of their fMRI response time series across brain regions. These results suggest that we are exceptionally similar to our friends in how we perceive and react to the world around us.

            Background: Perceiving social intent throughvocal intonation is impaired in schizophrenia; thisdysprosodia partly arisingfrom impaired pitch perception.Individuals with amusia (tone-deafness) are insensitive to pitch change andalso demonstrate prosody deficits. Sensitivity to rhythm is reduced in amusia when tonal sequences contain pitch changes (polytonic), but is normal for monotonic sequences, suggestingperceptual impairment originates at a secondary processing stage where pitch- and time- relatedcues are yoked.Here, we sought to ascertain: 1) whether schizophreniapatients demonstrate rhythmic deficits, 2) whether suchdeficits are restricted to polytonic sequences, and 3) how pitch and rhythm perception relate to prosodic processing.Methods: Seventy-sixparticipants (33 schizophrenia) completed tasks assessing pitch and prosody perception, as well as monotonic and polytonic rhythmic perception. Results: Increasing tone-deafness correlated with pitch-dependent rhythm detection impairments. Pitch and prosody correlated across all participants. Schizophreniapatients displayed basic time and pitch deficits. Correlations and path analyses indicated prosodic processing is an associatedfunction of pitch and pitch-dependent rhythm perception,with pure temporal processing playing an indirect role.In schizophrenia, deficits in monotonic and polytonic rhythmic perception did not contribute to prosodic processing dysfunction, and montonic rhythmic dysfunction and pitch perception did not covary. Conclusions: Exploring similarities between amusia and schizophrenia focused our characterization of prosodic processing as the function of sub-processes reflecting pitch and time perception,whichare prerequisite for prosodic processing. The uniqueness of dysprosodia in schizophrenia relative to other illnesses may be measured by idiosyncrasy in the pattern and magnitude of the sub-process task relationships.

            Objective: Humans are social creatures, with desires to connect or belong, producing loneliness when isolated. Individuals with schizophrenia are often more isolated than healthy adults and demonstrate profound social communication impairments such as vocal affect perception (prosody). Loneliness, levels of desire for social connectedness (need to belong, NTB), and their relationship to perception of social communications have not been investigated in schizophrenia. Method: In a sample of 69 individuals (36 SZ), we measured endorsements of loneliness and NTB, and evaluated their putative relationships to clinical symptoms and social communication abilities, as indexed by emotional prosody and pitch perception. Results: Loneliness endorsement was highly variable but particularly so in patients, whilst patients endorsed NTB at levels equivalent to healthy controls. In schizophrenia, pitch and prosody acuity were reduced, and prosody perception correlated with NTB. Loneliness, but not desire for social connectedness, correlated with negative symptoms. Conclusion: Loneliness and negative symptoms likely exert bidirectional effects on each other. Loneliness and desire to form interpersonal attachments may be pivotal in shaping and stimulating social interactions and, subsequently, the ability to perceive social intent through prosody. Intact NTB levels in patients augurs well for cognitive remediation which, target vocal-communication processing to improve social skills.

            Here we establish that contrary to expectations, Caenorhabditis elegans nematode worms possess a color discrimination system despite lacking any opsin or other photoreceptor genes. We found that simulated daylight guides C. elegans foraging decisions with respect to harmful bacteria that secrete a blue pigment toxin. By absorbing yellow-orange light, this blue pigment toxin alters the color of light sensed by the worm, and thereby triggers an increase in avoidance of harmful bacteria. These studies thus establish the existence of a color detection system that is distinct from those of other animals. In addition, these studies reveal an unexpected contribution of microbial color display to visual ecology.

            <p>by Renaud Bastien, Yasmine Meroz</p>

Nutation is an oscillatory movement that plants display during their development. Despite its ubiquity among plants movements, the relation between the observed movement and the underlying biological mechanisms remains unclear. Here we show that the kinematics of the full organ in 3D give a simple picture of plant nutation, where the orientation of the curvature along the main axis of the organ aligns with the direction of maximal differential growth. Within this framework we reexamine the validity of widely used experimental measurements of the apical tip as markers of growth dynamics. We show that though this relation is correct under certain conditions, it does not generally hold, and is not sufficient to uncover the specific role of each mechanism. As an example we re-interpret previously measured experimental observations using our model.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GyRf-v3w7qA" width="1" />

            <p>by Anna Klimovskaia, Stefan Ganscha, Manfred Claassen</p>

Stochastic chemical reaction networks constitute a model class to quantitatively describe dynamics and cell-to-cell variability in biological systems. The topology of these networks typically is only partially characterized due to experimental limitations. Current approaches for refining network topology are based on the explicit enumeration of alternative topologies and are therefore restricted to small problem instances with almost complete knowledge. We propose the <i>reactionet lasso</i>, a computational procedure that derives a stepwise sparse regression approach on the basis of the Chemical Master Equation, enabling large-scale structure learning for reaction networks by implicitly accounting for billions of topology variants. We have assessed the structure learning capabilities of the reactionet lasso on synthetic data for the complete TRAIL induced apoptosis signaling cascade comprising 70 reactions. We find that the reactionet lasso is able to efficiently recover the structure of these reaction systems, ab initio, with high sensitivity and specificity. With only &lt; 1% false discoveries, the reactionet lasso is able to recover 45% of all true reactions ab initio among &gt; 6000 possible reactions and over 10<sup>2000</sup> network topologies. In conjunction with information rich single cell technologies such as single cell RNA sequencing or mass cytometry, the reactionet lasso will enable large-scale structure learning, particularly in areas with partial network structure knowledge, such as cancer biology, and thereby enable the detection of pathological alterations of reaction networks. We provide software to allow for wide applicability of the reactionet lasso.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1Tsyn9eUT_o" width="1" />

            <p>by Andrew White, Malachi Tolman, Howard D. Thames, Hubert Rodney Withers, Kathy A. Mason, Mark K. Transtrum</p>

We explore the relationship among experimental design, parameter estimation, and systematic error in sloppy models. We show that the approximate nature of mathematical models poses challenges for experimental design in sloppy models. In many models of complex biological processes it is unknown what are the relevant physical mechanisms that must be included to explain system behaviors. As a consequence, models are often overly complex, with many practically unidentifiable parameters. Furthermore, which mechanisms are relevant/irrelevant vary among experiments. By selecting complementary experiments, experimental design may inadvertently make details that were ommitted from the model become relevant. When this occurs, the model will have a large systematic error and fail to give a good fit to the data. We use a simple hyper-model of model error to quantify a model’s discrepancy and apply it to two models of complex biological processes (EGFR signaling and DNA repair) with optimally selected experiments. We find that although parameters may be accurately estimated, the discrepancy in the model renders it less predictive than it was in the sloppy regime where systematic error is small. We introduce the concept of a <i>sloppy system</i>–a sequence of models of increasing complexity that become sloppy in the limit of microscopic accuracy. We explore the limits of accurate parameter estimation in sloppy systems and argue that identifying underlying mechanisms controlling system behavior is better approached by considering a hierarchy of models of varying detail rather than focusing on parameter estimation in a single model.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8tRjhaiR65g" width="1" />

            <p>by Angela Re, Levi Waldron, Alessandro Quattrone</p>

Transcript levels do not faithfully predict protein levels, due to post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression mediated by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and non-coding RNAs. We developed a multivariate linear regression model integrating RBP levels and predicted RBP-mRNA regulatory interactions from matched transcript and protein datasets. RBPs significantly improved the accuracy in predicting protein abundance of a portion of the total modeled mRNAs in three panels of tissues and cells and for different methods employed in the detection of mRNA and protein. The presence of upstream translation initiation sites (uTISs) at the mRNA 5’ untranslated regions was strongly associated with improvement in predictive accuracy. On the basis of these observations, we propose that the recently discovered widespread uTISs in the human genome can be a previously unappreciated substrate of translational control mediated by RBPs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/b1PGN2PjlYU" width="1" />

            <p>by Kari Y. Lam, Zachary M. Westrick, Christian L. Müller, Lionel Christiaen, Richard Bonneau</p>

Understanding gene regulatory networks is critical to understanding cellular differentiation and response to external stimuli. Methods for global network inference have been developed and applied to a variety of species. Most approaches consider the problem of network inference independently in each species, despite evidence that gene regulation can be conserved even in distantly related species. Further, network inference is often confined to single data-types (single platforms) and single cell types. We introduce a method for multi-source network inference that allows simultaneous estimation of gene regulatory networks in multiple species or biological processes through the introduction of priors based on known gene relationships such as orthology incorporated using fused regression. This approach improves network inference performance even when orthology mapping and conservation are incomplete. We refine this method by presenting an algorithm that extracts the true conserved subnetwork from a larger set of potentially conserved interactions and demonstrate the utility of our method in cross species network inference. Last, we demonstrate our method’s utility in learning from data collected on different experimental platforms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EGaRKF0FUFE" width="1" />

            <p>by Thomas LaBar, Christoph Adami</p>

A major aim of evolutionary biology is to explain the respective roles of adaptive versus non-adaptive changes in the evolution of complexity. While selection is certainly responsible for the spread and maintenance of complex phenotypes, this does not automatically imply that strong selection enhances the chance for the emergence of novel traits, that is, the origination of complexity. Population size is one parameter that alters the relative importance of adaptive and non-adaptive processes: as population size decreases, selection weakens and genetic drift grows in importance. Because of this relationship, many theories invoke a role for population size in the evolution of complexity. Such theories are difficult to test empirically because of the time required for the evolution of complexity in biological populations. Here, we used digital experimental evolution to test whether large or small asexual populations tend to evolve greater complexity. We find that both small and large—but not intermediate-sized—populations are favored to evolve larger genomes, which provides the opportunity for subsequent increases in phenotypic complexity. However, small and large populations followed different evolutionary paths towards these novel traits. Small populations evolved larger genomes by fixing slightly deleterious insertions, while large populations fixed rare beneficial insertions that increased genome size. These results demonstrate that genetic drift can lead to the evolution of complexity in small populations and that purifying selection is not powerful enough to prevent the evolution of complexity in large populations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-EtPMJ6VHVU" width="1" />

            <p>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep loss is associated with increased consumption of weight-promoting foods. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to mediate reward anticipation. However, the precise role of the PFC in mediating reward responses to highly palatable foods (HPF) after REM sleep deprivation is unclear. We selectively reduced REM sleep in mice over a 25–48 hr period and chemogenetically inhibited the medial PFC (mPFC) by using an altered glutamate-gated and ivermectin-gated chloride channel that facilitated neuronal inhibition through hyperpolarizing infected neurons. HPF consumption was measured while the mPFC was inactivated and REM sleep loss was induced. We found that REM sleep loss increased HPF consumption compared to control animals. However, mPFC inactivation reversed the effect of REM sleep loss on sucrose consumption without affecting fat consumption. Our findings provide, for the first time, a causal link between REM sleep, mPFC function and HPF consumption.</p>

            <p>Actin has well established functions in cellular morphogenesis. However, it is not well understood how the various actin assemblies in a cell are kept in a dynamic equilibrium, in particular when cells have to respond to acute signals. Here, we characterize a rapid and transient actin reset in response to increased intracellular calcium levels. Within seconds of calcium influx, the formin INF2 stimulates filament polymerization at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while cortical actin is disassembled. The reaction is then reversed within a few minutes. This Calcium-mediated actin reset (CaAR) occurs in a wide range of mammalian cell types and in response to many physiological cues. CaAR leads to transient immobilization of organelles, drives reorganization of actin during cell cortex repair, cell spreading and wound healing, and induces long-lasting changes in gene expression. Our findings suggest that CaAR acts as fundamental facilitator of cellular adaptations in response to acute signals and stress.</p>

            <p>Insulin and IGF signaling are critical to numerous developmental and physiological processes, with perturbations being pathognomonic of various diseases, including diabetes. Although the functional roles of the respective signaling pathways have been extensively studied, the control of insulin production and release is only partially understood. Herein, we show that in <em>Drosophila</em> expression of insulin-like peptides is regulated by neprilysin activity. Concomitant phenotypes of altered neprilysin expression included impaired food intake, reduced body size, and characteristic changes in the metabolite composition. Ectopic expression of a catalytically inactive mutant did not elicit any of the phenotypes, which confirms abnormal peptide hydrolysis as a causative factor. A screen for corresponding substrates of the neprilysin identified distinct peptides that regulate insulin-like peptide expression, feeding behavior, or both. The high functional conservation of neprilysins and their substrates renders the characterized principles applicable to numerous species, including higher eukaryotes and humans.</p>

            <p>DNA replication is a fundamental biological process. The initial step in eukaryotic DNA replication is the assembly of the pre-initiation complex, including the formation of two head-to-head hexameric helicases around the replication origin. How these hexameric helicases interact with their origin dsDNA remains unknown. Here, we report the co-crystal structure of the SV40 Large-T Antigen (LT) hexameric helicase bound to its origin dsDNA. The structure shows that the six subunits form a near-planar ring that interacts with the origin, so that each subunit makes unique contacts with the DNA. The origin dsDNA inside the narrower AAA+ domain channel shows partial melting due to the compression of the two phosphate backbones, forcing Watson-Crick base-pairs within the duplex to flip outward. This structure provides the first snapshot of a hexameric helicase binding to origin dsDNA, and suggests a possible mechanism of origin melting by LT during SV40 replication in eukaryotic cells.</p>

            <p>Brief experiences while a memory is consolidated may capture the consolidation, perhaps producing a maladaptive memory, or may interrupt the consolidation. Since consolidation occurs during sleep, even fleeting experiences when animals are awakened may produce maladaptive long-term memory, or may interrupt consolidation. In a learning paradigm affecting <em>Aplysia</em> feeding, when animals were trained after being awakened from sleep, interactions between new experiences and consolidation were prevented by blocking long-term memory arising from the new experiences. Inhibiting protein synthesis eliminated the block and allowed even a brief, generally ineffective training to produce long-term memory. Memory formation depended on consolidative proteins already expressed before training. After effective training, long term memory required subsequent transcription and translation. Memory formation during the sleep phase was correlated with increased CREB1 transcription, but not CREB2 transcription. Increased C/EBP transcription was a correlate of both effective and ineffective training and of treatments not producing memory.</p>

            <p>Left-right asymmetries in brains are usually minor or cryptic. We report brain asymmetries in the tiny, dorsal tubular nervous system of the ascidian tadpole larva, <em>Ciona intestinalis</em>. Chordate in body plan and development, the larva provides an outstanding example of brain asymmetry. Although early neural development is well studied, detailed cellular organization of the swimming larva’s CNS remains unreported. Using serial-section EM we document the synaptic connectome of the larva’s 177 CNS neurons. These formed 6618 synapses including 1772 neuromuscular junctions, augmented by 1206 gap junctions. Neurons are unipolar with at most a single dendrite, and few synapses. Some synapses are unpolarised, others form reciprocal or serial motifs; 922 were polyadic. Axo-axonal synapses predominate. Most neurons have ciliary organelles, and many features lack structural specialization. Despite equal cell numbers on both sides, neuron identities and pathways differ left/right. Brain vesicle asymmetries include a right ocellus and left coronet cells.</p>

            Language processing requires us to encode linear relations between acoustic forms and map them onto hierarchical relations between meaning units. Such relational binding of linguistic elements might recruit the hippocampus given its engagement by similar operations in other cognitive domains. Historically, hippocampal engagement in online language use has received little attention because patients with hippocampal damage are not aphasic. However, recent studies have found that these patients exhibit language impairments when the demands on flexible relational binding are high, suggesting that the hippocampus does, in fact, contribute to linguistic processing. A fundamental question is thus whether language processing engages domain-general hippocampal mechanisms that are also recruited across other cognitive processes or whether, instead, it relies on certain language-selective areas within the hippocampus. To address this question, we conducted the first systematic analysis of hippocampal engagement during comprehension in healthy adults (n=150 across three experiments) using fMRI. Specifically, we functionally localized putative "language-regions" within the hippocampus using a language comprehension task, and found that these regions (i) were selectively engaged by language but not by six non-linguistic tasks; and (ii) were coupled in their activity with the cortical language network during both "rest" and especially story comprehension, but not with the domain-general "multiple-demand (MD)" network. This functional profile did not generalize to other hippocampal regions that were localized using a non-linguistic, working memory task. These findings suggest that some hippocampal mechanisms that maintain and integrate information during language comprehension are not domain-general but rather belong to the language-specific brain network.

            <p>by Haixu Tang, Sujun Li, Yuzhen Ye</p>

Metaproteomic studies adopt the common bottom-up proteomics approach to investigate the protein composition and the dynamics of protein expression in microbial communities. When matched metagenomic and/or metatranscriptomic data of the microbial communities are available, metaproteomic data analyses often employ a metagenome-guided approach, in which complete or fragmental protein-coding genes are first directly predicted from metagenomic (and/or metatranscriptomic) sequences or from their assemblies, and the resulting protein sequences are then used as the reference database for peptide/protein identification from MS/MS spectra. This approach is often limited because protein coding genes predicted from metagenomes are incomplete and fragmental. In this paper, we present a graph-centric approach to improving metagenome-guided peptide and protein identification in metaproteomics. Our method exploits the <i>de Bruijn</i> graph structure reported by metagenome assembly algorithms to generate a comprehensive database of protein sequences encoded in the community. We tested our method using several public metaproteomic datasets with matched metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing data acquired from complex microbial communities in a biological wastewater treatment plant. The results showed that many more peptides and proteins can be identified when assembly graphs were utilized, improving the characterization of the proteins expressed in the microbial communities. The additional proteins we identified contribute to the characterization of important pathways such as those involved in degradation of chemical hazards.

Based on the identified segmental distribution of galaninergic neurons, the ability for penile vibratory stimulation (PVS) to elicit ejaculation when the concerned spinal segments were injured was studied in 384 patients with clinically complete spinal cord injury (SCI) and consequent anejaculation. Such patients represent a unique model to investigate the role of defined spinal segments in the control of ejaculation.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24819-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Galaninergic neurons were mostly located between L2 and L5 segments in medial lamina VII, with a maximal density within L4. Three-dimensional 3D reconstruction showed that these neurons were grouped into single columns bilaterally to the central canal. In addition, galaninergic neuron density was found higher in L3 and L4 segments in men as compared to women supporting sexual dimorphism. In the patients' cohort, injury of L3–L5 segments was the sole independent predictor for failure of PVS to induce ejaculation. Although evidence from clinical observations was indirect, there is close correspondence to neuroanatomical data.</p></div></div>

            Reward learning depends on accurate reward associations with potential choices. Two separate outcome dimensions, namely the valence (positive or negative) and surprise (the absolute degree of deviation from expectations) of an outcome are thought to subserve adaptive decision-making and learning, however their neural correlates and relative contribution to learning remain debated. Here, we coupled single-trial analyses of electroencephalography with simultaneously acquired fMRI, while participants performed a probabilistic reversal-learning task, to offer evidence of temporally overlapping but largely distinct spatial representations of outcome valence and surprise in the human brain. Electrophysiological variability in outcome valence correlated with activity in regions of the human reward network promoting approach or avoidance learning. Variability in outcome surprise correlated primarily with activity in regions of the human attentional network controlling the speed of learning. Crucially, despite the largely separate spatial extend of these representations we also found a linear superposition of the two outcome dimensions in a smaller network encompassing visuo-mnemonic and reward areas. This spatiotemporal overlap was uniquely exposed by our EEG-informed fMRI approach. Activity in this network was further predictive of stimulus value updating indicating a comparable contribution of both signals to reward learning.

            In the present study, we present a theoretical framework combining experimental characterizations and analytical calculus to capture the firing rate input-output properties of single neurons in the fluctuation-driven regime. We use this framework to investigate the functional impact of the heterogeneity in firing responses found experimentally in young mice layer V pyramidal cells. We first design and calibrate in vitro a simplified morphological model of layer V pyramidal neurons with a dendritic tree following Rall's branching rule. Then, we propose an analytical derivation for the membrane potential fluctuations at the soma as a function of the properties of the synaptic bombardment in dendrites. This mathematical description allows us to easily emulate various forms of presynaptic activities: either balanced, unbalanced, synchronized, purely proximal or purely distal synaptic activity. We found that those different forms of activity led to various comodulations of the membrane potential fluctuation properties, thus raising the question whether individual neurons might differentially couple to specific forms of activity because of their different firing responses. We indeed found such a heterogeneous response for all types of presynaptic activity. This heterogeneity was explained by different levels of cellular excitability in the case of the balanced, unbalanced, synchronized and purely distal activity. A notable exception appeared for proximal activity: increasing activity could either promote firing response in some cells or suppress it in some other cells whatever their individual excitability. This behavior could only be explained by various sensitivities to the speed of the fluctuations, which was previously associated to heterogeneous levels of sodium channel inactivation and density. Because local network connectivity targets rather proximal region, our results suggest that this biophysical heterogeneity might be relevant to neocortical processing by controlling how individual neurons couple to local network activity.

            Orientation selective surround suppression (OSSS) is a reduction in the perceived contrast of a stimulus, which occurs when a collinear grating is placed adjacent to the stimulus. Attention affects performance on many visual tasks, and we asked whether the perceptual effects of OSSS are mitigated through the allocation of voluntary visual-spatial attention. Participants were tested in a contrast discrimination task: at the beginning of each trial, one location on the screen was cued and a subsequent contrast judgment was then more likely (70%) to be performed in that location. Replicating previous results, we found that the point of subjective equality (PSE) was elevated for a collinear, relative to an orthogonal, surround. While the PSE was similar for validly and invalidly cued trials, the just noticeable difference (JND) was larger for invalid cue trials, and for collinear, relative to orthogonal surround, suggesting that while OSSS affects both perceived contrast and sensitivity, voluntary attention affects only perceptual sensitivity. In another experiment no informative cue was provided, and attention was distributed over the entire display. In this case, JND and PSE were shifted depending on the contrast of the distractor, suggesting that OSSS is affected by the allocation of visual-spatial attention, but only under conditions of distributed attention.

            While attention is known to improve information processing, whether attention can alter visual appearance has been a cornerstone of debate for 100+ years. Although recent studies suggest that attention can alter appearance, it has been argued that the reported appearance changes reflect response bias. Here, we provide a resolution to this debate by showing that attention has different effects on appearance and response bias depending on stimulus visibility. In a contrast judgment task where the contrast of attended and unattended stimuli varied across a full range of contrast values, human participants exhibited a substantial amount of response bias to the attended stimulus, when stimuli were hard to see. However, when stimuli were easier to see, response bias decreased and attention primarily increased perceived contrast. These results help constrain philosophical arguments about the cognitive penetrability of perception and reconcile the long-standing debate about the attention effect on appearance and response bias.

            Attention supports the selection of relevant sensory information from competing irrelevant sensory information. This selective processing is thought to be supported via the attentional gain amplification of sensory responses evoked by attended compared to unattended stimuli. However, recent studies in highly trained subjects suggest that attentional gain plays a relatively modest role and that other types of neural modulations, such as a reduction in neural noise, better explain attention-related changes in behavior. We hypothesized that the amount of training may alter neural mechanisms that support attentional selection in visual cortex. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the influence of training on attentional modulations of stimulus-evoked visual responses by recording electroencephalography (EEG) from humans performing a selective visuospatial attention task over the course of one month. Early in training, visuospatial attention induced a robust attentional gain amplification of sensory-evoked responses in contralateral visual cortex that emerged within ~100ms after stimulus onset, and a quantitative model based on signal detection theory (SDT) successfully linked this attentional gain amplification to attention-related improvements in behavior. However, after training, this attentional gain amplification of visual responses was almost completely eliminated and modeling suggested that noise reduction was required to link the amplitude of visual responses with attentional modulations of behavior. These findings suggest that the neural mechanisms supporting selective attention can change as a function of training and expertise, and help to bridge different results from studies carried out in different model systems that require substantially different amount of training.

            <p>Protein Kinase A (PKA) mediates synaptic plasticity and is widely implicated in learning and memory. The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is thought to be responsible for processing and encoding distinct contextual associations in response to highly similar inputs. The mossy fiber (MF) axons of the dentate granule cells convey strong excitatory drive to CA3 pyramidal neurons and express presynaptic, PKA-dependent forms of plasticity. Here, we demonstrate an essential role for the PKA anchoring protein, AKAP7, in mouse MF axons and terminals. Genetic ablation of AKAP7 specifically from dentate granule cells results in disruption of MF-CA3 LTP directly initiated by cAMP, and the AKAP7 mutant mice are selectively deficient in pattern separation behaviors. Our results suggest that the AKAP7/PKA complex in the MF projections plays an essential role in synaptic plasticity and contextual memory formation.</p>

            <p>by Jennifer Scheidel, Leonie Amstein, Jörg Ackermann, Ivan Dikic, Ina Koch</p>

The degradation of cytosol-invading pathogens by autophagy, a process known as xenophagy, is an important mechanism of the innate immune system. Inside the host, <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium invades epithelial cells and resides within a specialized intracellular compartment, the <i>Salmonella</i>-containing vacuole. A fraction of these bacteria does not persist inside the vacuole and enters the host cytosol. <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium that invades the host cytosol becomes a target of the autophagy machinery for degradation. The xenophagy pathway has recently been discovered, and the exact molecular processes are not entirely characterized. Complete kinetic data for each molecular process is not available, so far. We developed a mathematical model of the xenophagy pathway to investigate this key defense mechanism. In this paper, we present a Petri net model of <i>Salmonella</i> xenophagy in epithelial cells. The model is based on functional information derived from literature data. It comprises the molecular mechanism of galectin-8-dependent and ubiquitin-dependent autophagy, including regulatory processes, like nutrient-dependent regulation of autophagy and TBK1-dependent activation of the autophagy receptor, OPTN. To model the activation of TBK1, we proposed a new mechanism of TBK1 activation, suggesting a spatial and temporal regulation of this process. Using standard Petri net analysis techniques, we found basic functional modules, which describe different pathways of the autophagic capture of <i>Salmonella</i> and reflect the basic dynamics of the system. To verify the model, we performed <i>in silico</i> knockout experiments. We introduced a new concept of knockout analysis to systematically compute and visualize the results, using an <i>in silico</i> knockout matrix. The results of the <i>in silico</i> knockout analyses were consistent with published experimental results and provide a basis for future investigations of the <i>Salmonella</i> xenophagy pathway.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RhgQLlAIOpY" width="1" />

            <p>Apicomplexan parasites contain a conserved protein CelTOS that, in malaria parasites, is essential for traversal of cells within the mammalian host and arthropod vector. However, the molecular role of CelTOS is unknown because it lacks sequence similarity to proteins of known function. Here, we determined the crystal structure of CelTOS and discovered CelTOS resembles proteins that bind to and disrupt membranes. In contrast to known membrane disruptors, CelTOS has a distinct architecture, specifically binds phosphatidic acid commonly present within the inner leaflet of plasma membranes, and potently disrupts liposomes composed of phosphatidic acid by forming pores. Microinjection of CelTOS into cells resulted in observable membrane damage. Therefore, CelTOS is unique as it achieves nearly universal inner leaflet cellular activity to enable the exit of parasites from cells during traversal. By providing novel molecular insight into cell traversal by apicomplexan parasites, our work facilitates the design of therapeutics against global pathogens.</p>

            <p>Migration of skeletal muscle precursor cells is a key step during limb muscle development and depends on the activity of PAX3 and MET. Here, we demonstrate that BRAF serves a crucial function in formation of limb skeletal muscles during mouse embryogenesis downstream of MET and acts as a potent inducer of myoblast cell migration. We found that a fraction of BRAF accumulates in the nucleus after activation and endosomal transport to a perinuclear position. Mass spectrometry based screening for potential interaction partners revealed that BRAF interacts and phosphorylates PAX3. Mutation of BRAF dependent phosphorylation sites in PAX3 impaired the ability of PAX3 to promote migration of C2C12 myoblasts indicating that BRAF directly activates PAX3. Since PAX3 stimulates transcription of the <em>Met</em> gene we propose that MET signaling via BRAF fuels a positive feedback loop, which maintains high levels of PAX3 and MET activity required for limb muscle precursor cell migration.</p>

            <p>The framework of criticality provides a unifying perspective on neuronal dynamics from <i>in vitro</i> cortical cultures to functioning human brains. Recent findings suggest that a healthy cortex displays critical dynamics, giving rise to scale-free spatiotemporal cascades of activity, termed neuronal avalanches. Pharmacological manipulations of the excitation-inhibition balance (EIB) in cortical cultures were previously shown to result in deviations from criticality and from the power law scaling of avalanche size distribution. To examine the sensitivity of neuronal avalanche metrics to altered EIB in humans, we focused on epilepsy, a neurological disorder characterized by hyperexcitable networks. Using magnetoencephalography, we quantitatively assessed deviations from criticality in the brain dynamics of patients with epilepsy during interictal (between-seizures) activity. Compared with healthy control subjects, epilepsy patients tended to exhibit a higher neural gain and larger avalanches, particularly during interictal epileptiform activity. Moreover, deviations from scale-free behavior were exclusively connected to brief intervals at epileptiform discharges, strengthening the association between deviations from criticality and the instantaneous changes in EIB. The avalanches collected during interictal epileptiform activity had not only a stereotypical size range but also involved particular spatial patterns of activations, as expected for periods of epileptic network dominance. Overall, the neuronal avalanche metrics provide a quantitative novel description of interictal brain activity of patients with epilepsy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Healthy brain dynamics requires a delicate balance between excitatory and inhibitory processes. Several brain disorders, such as epilepsy, are associated with altered excitation-inhibition balance, but assessing this balance using noninvasive tools is still challenging. In this study, we apply the framework of critical brain dynamics to data from epilepsy patients, which were recorded between seizures. We show that metrics of criticality provide a sensitive tool for noninvasive assessment of changes in the balance. Specifically, brain activity of epilepsy patients deviates from healthy critical brain dynamics, particularly during abnormal epileptiform activity. The study offers a novel quantitative perspective on epilepsy and its relation to healthy brain dynamics.</p>

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: The main goal of dopamine cell replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) is to provide clinical benefit mediated by graft survival with nigrostriatal reinnervation. We report a dichotomy between graft structure and clinical function in a patient dying sixteen years following fetal nigral grafting.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: A 55-year-old levodopa-responsive woman with PD received bilateral putamenal fetal mesencephalic grafts as part of an NIH-sponsored double-blind sham-controlled trial. The patient never experienced clinical benefit and her course was complicated by the development of graft-related dyskinesias. Fluorodopa positron emission tomography (FD-PET) demonstrated significant increases post-grafting bilaterally. She experienced worsening of parkinsonism with severe dyskinesias, and underwent STN-DBS 8 years after grafting. She died 16-years post-transplantation.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Post-mortem analyses confirmed the diagnosis of PD and demonstrated &gt;300,000 tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive grafted cells per side with normalized striatal TH-ir fiber innervation and bidirectional synaptic connectivity. 27% and 17% of grafted neurons were serine 129-phosphorylated alpha synuclein positive in the left and right putamen respectively.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: These findings represent the largest number of surviving dopamine neurons and the densest and most widespread graft-mediated striatal dopamine reinnervation following a transplant procedure reported to date. Despite this, clinical recovery was not observed. Further, the grafts were associated with a form of dyskinesias that resembled diphasic dyskinesia and persisted in the off-medication state. We hypothesize that the grafted cells produced a low level of dopamine sufficient to cause a levodopa-independent continuous form of diphasic dyskinesias, but insufficient to provide an anti-parkinsonian benefit.

            <p>The Hsp104 disaggregase is a two-ring ATPase machine that rescues various forms of non-native proteins including the highly resistant amyloid fibers. The structural-mechanistic underpinnings of how the recovery of toxic protein aggregates is promoted and how this potent unfolding activity is prevented from doing collateral damage to cellular proteins are not well understood. Here, we present structural and biochemical data revealing the organization of Hsp104 from <em>Chaetomium thermophilum</em> at 3.7 Å resolution. We show that the coiled-coil domains encircling the disaggregase constitute a ‘restraint mask’ that sterically controls the mobility and thus the unfolding activity of the ATPase modules. In addition, we identify a mechanical linkage that coordinates the activity of the two ATPase rings and accounts for the high unfolding potential of Hsp104. Based on these findings, we propose a general model for how Hsp104 and related chaperones operate and are kept under control until recruited to appropriate substrates.</p>

            <p>Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in <em>Frataxin</em> (<em>FXN</em>). Loss of <em>FXN</em> causes impaired mitochondrial function and iron homeostasis. An elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was previously proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of FRDA. We recently showed that loss of <em>frataxin homolog</em> (<em>fh</em>), a <em>Drosophila</em> homolog of <em>FXN</em>, causes a ROS independent neurodegeneration in flies (Chen et al., 2016). In <em>fh</em> mutants, iron accumulation in the nervous system enhances the synthesis of sphingolipids, which in turn activates 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdk1) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2) to trigger neurodegeneration of adult photoreceptors. Here, we show that loss of <em>Fxn</em> in the nervous system in mice also activates an iron/sphingolipid/PDK1/Mef2 pathway, indicating that the mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore, sphingolipid levels and PDK1 activity are also increased in hearts of FRDA patients, suggesting that a similar pathway is affected in FRDA.</p>

            <p>Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation is mediated by soluble and physical cues. In this study, we investigated differentiation-induced transformations in MSC cellular and nuclear biophysical properties and queried their role in mechanosensation. Our data show that nuclei in differentiated bovine and human MSCs stiffen and become resistant to deformation. This attenuated nuclear deformation was governed by restructuring of Lamin A/C and increased heterochromatin content. This change in nuclear stiffness sensitized MSCs to mechanical-loading-induced calcium signaling and differentiated marker expression. This sensitization was reversed when the ‘stiff’ differentiated nucleus was softened and was enhanced when the ‘soft’ undifferentiated nucleus was stiffened through pharmacologic treatment. Interestingly, dynamic loading of undifferentiated MSCs, in the absence of soluble differentiation factors, stiffened and condensed the nucleus, and increased mechanosensitivity more rapidly than soluble factors. These data suggest that the nucleus acts as a mechanostat to modulate cellular mechanosensation during differentiation.</p>

            <p>In multicellular organisms, cells adopt various shapes, from flattened sheets of endothelium to dendritic neurons, that allow the cells to function effectively. Here, we elucidated the unique shape of cells in the cornified stratified epithelia of the mammalian epidermis that allows them to achieve homeostasis of the tight junction (TJ) barrier. Using intimate in vivo 3D imaging, we found that the basic shape of TJ-bearing cells is a flattened Kelvin's tetrakaidecahedron (f-TKD), an optimal shape for filling space. In vivo live imaging further elucidated the dynamic replacement of TJs on the edges of f-TKD cells that enables the TJ-bearing cells to translocate across the TJ barrier.

            <p>Robust preference for fermentative glucose metabolism has motivated domestication of the budding yeast <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>. This program can be circumvented by a protein-based genetic element, the [<em>GAR</em><sup>+</sup>] prion, permitting simultaneous metabolism of glucose and other carbon sources. Diverse bacteria can elicit yeast cells to acquire [<em>GAR</em><sup>+</sup>], although the molecular details of this interaction remain unknown. Here we identify the common bacterial metabolite lactic acid as a strong [<em>GAR</em><sup>+</sup>] inducer. Transient exposure to lactic acid caused yeast cells to heritably circumvent glucose repression. This trait had the defining genetic properties of [<em>GAR</em><sup>+</sup>], and did not require utilization of lactic acid as a carbon source. Lactic acid also induced [<em>GAR</em><sup>+</sup>]-like epigenetic states in fungi that diverged from <em>S. cerevisiae</em> ~200 million years ago, and in which glucose repression evolved independently. To our knowledge, this is the first study to uncover a bacterial metabolite with the capacity to potently induce a prion.</p>

            <p>Animals require molecular signals to determine when to divert resources from somatic functions to reproduction. This decision is vital in animals that reproduce in an all-or-nothing mode, such as bristle worms: females committed to reproduction spend roughly half their body mass for yolk and egg production; following mass spawning, the parents die. An enigmatic brain hormone activity suppresses reproduction. We now identify this hormone as the sesquiterpenoid methylfarnesoate. Methylfarnesoate suppresses transcript levels of the yolk precursor Vitellogenin both in cell culture and <em>in vivo</em>, directly inhibiting a central energy–costly step of reproductive maturation. We reveal that contrary to common assumptions, sesquiterpenoids are ancient animal hormones present in marine and terrestrial lophotrochozoans. In turn, insecticides targeting this pathway suppress vitellogenesis in cultured worm cells. These findings challenge current views of animal hormone evolution, and indicate that non-target species and marine ecosystems are susceptible to commonly used insect larvicides.</p>

            <p>The multi-domain splicing factor RBM5 regulates the balance between antagonistic isoforms of the apoptosis-control genes <em>FAS/CD95</em>, <em>Caspase-2</em> and <em>AID</em>. An OCRE (OCtamer REpeat of aromatic residues) domain found in RBM5 is important for alternative splicing regulation and mediates interactions with components of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP. We show that the RBM5 OCRE domain adopts a unique β–sheet fold. NMR and biochemical experiments demonstrate that the OCRE domain directly binds to the proline-rich C-terminal tail of the essential snRNP core proteins SmN/B/B’. The NMR structure of an OCRE-SmN peptide complex reveals a specific recognition of poly-proline helical motifs in SmN/B/B’. Mutation of conserved aromatic residues impairs binding to the Sm proteins <em>in vitro</em> and compromises RBM5-mediated alternative splicing regulation of FAS/CD95. Thus, RBM5 OCRE represents a poly-proline recognition domain that mediates critical interactions with the C-terminal tail of the spliceosomal SmN/B/B’ proteins in <em>FAS/CD95</em> alternative splicing regulation.</p>

            <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>—Several prion amplification systems have been proposed for detection of prions in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), most recently, the measurements of prion seeding activity with second-generation real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC). The objective of this study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of the RT-QuIC prion test in the broad phenotypic spectrum of prion diseases.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>— We performed CSF RT-QuIC testing in 2,141 patients who had rapidly progressive neurological disorders, determined diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in 272 cases which were autopsied, and evaluated the impact of mutations and polymorphisms in the <em>PRNP</em> gene, and Type 1 or Type 2 of human prions on diagnostic performance.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>—The 98.5% diagnostic specificity and 92% sensitivity of CSF RT-QuIC in a blinded retrospective analysis matched the 100% specificity and 95% sensitivity of a blind prospective study. The CSF RT-QuIC differentiated 94% of cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) MM1 from the sCJD MM2 phenotype, and 80% of sCJD VV2 from sCJD VV1. The mixed prion type 1-2 and cases heterozygous for codon 129 generated intermediate CSF RT-QuIC patterns, while genetic prion diseases revealed distinct profiles for each <em>PRNP</em> gene mutation.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>—The diagnostic performance of the improved CSF RT-QuIC is superior to surrogate marker tests for prion diseases such as 14-3-3 and Tau proteins and together with <em>PRNP</em> gene sequencing, the test allows the major prion subtypes to be differentiated in vivo. This differentiation facilitates prediction of the clinicopathological phenotype and duration of the disease—two important considerations for envisioned therapeutic interventions.

            <p>Previous studies provided evidence for the alteration of brain cholesterol homeostasis in 129.<em>Mecp2</em>-null mice, an experimental model of Rett syndrome. The efficacy of statins in improving motor symptoms and prolonging survival of mutant mice suggested a potential role of statins in the therapy of Rett syndrome. In the present study, we show that <em>Mecp2</em> deletion had no effect on brain and reduced serum cholesterol levels and lovastatin (1.5 mg/kg, twice weekly as in the previous study) had no effects on motor deficits and survival when <em>Mecp2</em> deletion was expressed on a background strain (C57BL/6J; B6) differing from that used in the earlier study. These findings indicate that the effects of statins may be background specific and raise important issues to consider when contemplating clinical trials. The reduction of the brain cholesterol metabolite 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC) found in B6.<em>Mecp2</em>-null mice suggests the occurrence of changes in brain cholesterol metabolism and the potential utility of using plasma levels of 24S-OHC as a biomarker of brain cholesterol homeostasis in RTT.</p>

            <p>Natural isolates of <em>C. elegans</em> differ in their sensitivity to pheromones that inhibit exploratory behavior. Previous studies identified a QTL for pheromone sensitivity that includes alternative alleles of <em>srx-43,</em> a chemoreceptor that inhibits exploration through its activity in ASI sensory neurons. Here we show that the QTL is multigenic and includes alternative alleles of <em>srx-44,</em> a second chemoreceptor gene that modifies pheromone sensitivity. <em>srx-44</em> either promotes or inhibits exploration depending on its expression in the ASJ or ADL sensory neurons, respectively. Naturally occurring pheromone insensitivity results in part from previously described changes in <em>srx-43</em> expression levels, and in part from increased <em>srx-44</em> expression in ASJ, which antagonizes ASI and ADL. Antagonism between the sensory neurons results in cellular epistasis that is reflected in their transcription of insulin genes that regulate exploration. These results and genome-wide evidence suggest that chemoreceptor genes may be preferred sites of adaptive variation in <em>C. elegans</em>.</p>

The mTOR pathway was activated, as in cases with dysplasia, but the immunoreactivities of nucleoporin p62, DEP-domain containing protein 5, clathrin, and dynamin-1 were different between groups, suggesting that enhanced autophagy flux and abnormal synaptic vesicle trafficking contribute to early lipofuscin aggregation in these cases, compared to suppression of autophagy in cases with typical dysplasia.

Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is one such condition, resulting from a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5′ leader sequence of the <em>FMR1</em> gene. RAN proteins from the CGG repeat accumulate in ubiquitinated inclusions in FXTAS patient brains and elicit toxicity. In addition to the CGG repeat, an antisense mRNA containing a CCG repeat is also transcribed from the <em>FMR1</em> locus. We evaluated whether this antisense CCG repeat supports RAN translation and contributes to pathology in FXTAS patients.</p></div></div>

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a negative prognostic factor in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and is associated with permanent shunt dependency in a substantial proportion of patients after ICH. IVH treatment by intraventricular fibrinolysis (IVF) was recently linked to reduced mortality rates in the CLEAR III study and IVF represents a safe and effective strategy to hasten clot resolution that may reduce shunt rates. Additionally, promising results from observational studies reported reductions in shunt dependency for a combined treatment approach of IVF plus lumbar drains (LD). The present randomized controlled trial investigated efficacy and safety of a combined strategy – IVF plus LD <em>versus</em> IVF alone – on shunt dependency in patients with ICH and severe IVH.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>This randomized, open-label, parallel-group study included patients aged 18-85 years, pre-hospital modified Rankin Scale ≤3, ICH volume &lt;60 ml, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of &lt;9, and severe IVH with tamponade of the third and fourth ventricles requiring placement of external ventricular drainage (EVD). Over a 3 year recruitment period, patients were allocated to either standard treatment (control group receiving intraventricular fibrinolysis (IVF) consisting of 1 mg rt-PA every 8 hours until clot-clearance of 3rd and 4th ventricles) or a combined treatment approach of IVF and – upon clot-clearance of 3rd and 4th ventricles – subsequent placement of a LD for drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (intervention group). The primary endpoint consisted of permanent shunt placement indicated after a total of three unsuccessful EVD clamping attempts or need for CSF-drainage longer than 14 days in both groups. Secondary endpoints included IVF- and LD-related safety, such as bleeding or infections, and functional outcome at 90 and 180 days. Conducted endpoint analyses employed individual patient data meta-analyses. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01041950).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The trial was stopped upon pre-defined interim analysis after 30 patients because of significant efficacy of tested intervention. The primary endpoint was analyzed without dropouts and was reached in 43%(7/16) of the control group <em>versus</em> 0%(0/14) of the intervention group(p=0.007). Meta-analyses were based on overall 97 patients, 45 patients receiving IVF plus LD <em>versus</em> 42 patients with IVF only. Meta-analyses on shunt-dependency showed an absolute risk-reduction of 24% for the intervention (LD:2.2%(1/45) <em>versus</em> no-LD:26.2%(11/42)); odds-ratio=0.062,CI(0.011-0.361),p=0.002. Secondary endpoints did not show significant differences for CSF-infections (OR=0.869,CI(0.445-1.695),p=0.680) and functional outcome at 90 days (OR=0.478,CI(0.190-1.201),p=0.116), yet bleeding complications were significantly reduced in favor of the intervention (OR=0.401,CI(0.302-0.532),p&lt;0.001).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The present trial and individual patient data meta-analyses provides evidence that in patients with severe IVH, as compared to IVF alone, a combined approach of IVF plus LD treatment is feasible and safe, and significantly reduces rates of permanent shunt dependency for aresorptive hydrocephalus after ICH.

            50 years ago, scientists made plans to use nuclear explosions to extract natural gas from underground. In one such experiment, the gas was released but turned out to be radioactive.
