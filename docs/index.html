            <p>by Oded Barzelay, Miriam Furst, Omri Barak</p>

Our acoustical environment abounds with repetitive sounds, some of which are related to pitch perception. It is still unknown how the auditory system, in processing these sounds, relates a physical stimulus and its percept. Since, in mammals, all auditory stimuli are conveyed into the nervous system through the auditory nerve (AN) fibers, a model should explain the perception of pitch as a function of this particular input. However, pitch perception is invariant to certain features of the physical stimulus. For example, a missing fundamental stimulus with resolved or unresolved harmonics, or a low and high-level amplitude stimulus with the same spectral content–these all give rise to the same percept of pitch. In contrast, the AN representations for these different stimuli are not invariant to these effects. In fact, due to saturation and non-linearity of both cochlear and inner hair cells responses, these differences are enhanced by the AN fibers. Thus there is a difficulty in explaining how pitch percept arises from the activity of the AN fibers. We introduce a novel approach for extracting pitch cues from the AN population activity for a given arbitrary stimulus. The method is based on a technique known as sparse coding (SC). It is the representation of pitch cues by a few spatiotemporal atoms (templates) from among a large set of possible ones (a dictionary). The amount of activity of each atom is represented by a non-zero coefficient, analogous to an active neuron. Such a technique has been successfully applied to other modalities, particularly vision. The model is composed of a cochlear model, an SC processing unit, and a harmonic sieve. We show that the model copes with different pitch phenomena: extracting resolved and non-resolved harmonics, missing fundamental pitches, stimuli with both high and low amplitudes, iterated rippled noises, and recorded musical instruments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r_-GuytEkBk" width="1" />

            <p>Excitotoxic mechanisms contribute to the degeneration of hippocampal pyramidal neurons after recurrent seizures and brain ischemia. However, susceptibility differs, with CA1 neurons degenerating preferentially after global ischemia and CA3 neurons after limbic seizures. Whereas most studies address contributions of excitotoxic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, it is apparent that Zn<sup>2+</sup> also contributes, reflecting accumulation in neurons either after synaptic release and entry through postsynaptic channels or upon mobilization from intracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins such as metallothionein-III (MT-III). Using mouse hippocampal slices to study acute oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-triggered neurodegeneration, we found evidence for early contributions of excitotoxic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in both CA1 and CA3, as indicated by the ability of Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelators or Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry blockers to delay pyramidal neuronal death in both regions. However, using knock-out animals (of MT-III and vesicular Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporter, ZnT3) and channel blockers revealed substantial differences in relevant Zn<sup>2+</sup> sources, with critical contributions of presynaptic release and its permeation through Ca<sup>2+</sup>- (and Zn<sup>2+</sup>)-permeable AMPA channels in CA3 and Zn<sup>2+</sup> mobilization from MT-III predominating in CA1. To assess the consequences of the intracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation, we used OGD exposures slightly shorter than those causing acute neuronal death; under these conditions, cytosolic Zn<sup>2+</sup> rises persisted for 10–30 min after OGD, followed by recovery over ~40–60 min. Furthermore, the recovery appeared to be accompanied by mitochondrial Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation (via the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter MCU) in CA1 but not in CA3 neurons and was markedly diminished in MT-III knock-outs, suggesting that it depended upon Zn<sup>2+</sup> mobilization from this protein.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The basis for the differential vulnerabilities of CA1 versus CA3 pyramidal neurons is unclear. The present study of events during and after acute oxygen glucose deprivation highlights a possible important difference, with rapid synaptic entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> contributing more in CA3, but with delayed and long-lasting accumulation of Zn<sup>2+</sup> within mitochondria occurring in CA1 but not CA3 pyramidal neurons. These data may be consistent with observations of prominent mitochondrial dysfunction as a critical early event in the delayed degeneration of CA1 neurons after ischemia and support a hypothesis that mitochondrial Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in the early reperfusion period may be a critical and targetable upstream event in the injury cascade.</p>

            <p>Fine judgments of stereoscopic depth rely mainly on relative judgments of depth (relative binocular disparity) between objects, rather than judgments of the distance to where the eyes are fixating (absolute disparity). In macaques, visual area V2 is the earliest site in the visual processing hierarchy for which neurons selective for relative disparity have been observed (Thomas et al., 2002). Here, we found that, in macaques trained to perform a fine disparity discrimination task, disparity-selective neurons in V2 were highly selective for the task, and their activity correlated with the animals' perceptual decisions (unexplained by the stimulus). This may partially explain similar correlations reported in downstream areas. Although compatible with a perceptual role of these neurons for the task, the interpretation of such decision-related activity is complicated by the effects of interneuronal "noise" correlations between sensory neurons. Recent work has developed simple predictions to differentiate decoding schemes (Pitkow et al., 2015) without needing measures of noise correlations, and found that data from early sensory areas were compatible with optimal linear readout of populations with information-limiting correlations. In contrast, our data here deviated significantly from these predictions. We additionally tested this prediction for previously reported results of decision-related activity in V2 for a related task, coarse disparity discrimination (Nienborg and Cumming, 2006), thought to rely on absolute disparity. Although these data followed the predicted pattern, they violated the prediction quantitatively. This suggests that optimal linear decoding of sensory signals is not generally a good predictor of behavior in simple perceptual tasks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Activity in sensory neurons that correlates with an animal's decision is widely believed to provide insights into how the brain uses information from sensory neurons. Recent theoretical work developed simple predictions to differentiate decoding schemes, and found support for optimal linear readout of early sensory populations with information-limiting correlations. Here, we observed decision-related activity for neurons in visual area V2 of macaques performing fine disparity discrimination, as yet the earliest site for this task. These findings, and previously reported results from V2 in a different task, deviated from the predictions for optimal linear readout of a population with information-limiting correlations. Our results suggest that optimal linear decoding of early sensory information is not a general decoding strategy used by the brain.</p>

            <p>The mossy fibers (MFs) corelease glutamate and GABA onto pyramidal cells of CA3 during development, until the end of the third postnatal week. However, the major target cells of the MF are the interneurons of CA3. Therefore, it has been shown that the interneurons of the hilus and stratum lucidum receive this dual monosynaptic input on MF stimulation. Because the plasticity of glutamatergic transmission from the different terminals of the MF is target specific, we here asked whether the corelease of glutamate and GABA was also subjected to a target-dependent compartmentalization. We analyzed the occurrence and plasticity of MF simultaneous glutamatergic–GABAergic signaling onto interneurons of the different strata of CA3 in rats during the third postnatal week. We show the coexistence of time-locked, glutamate receptor and GABA receptor-mediated mono synaptic responses evoked by MF stimulation in interneurons from stratum lucidum and stratum radiatum, but not in interneurons from stratum lacunosum-moleculare. As expected from the transmission of MF origin, MF GABAergic responses were depressed by the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. Strikingly, while MF glutamatergic responses underwent LTD, the simultaneous MF GABAergic responses of stratum lucidum interneurons, but not of stratum radiatum interneurons, displayed a Hebbian form of LTP that was mimicked by PKC activation. PKA activation potentiated MF glutamatergic responses of stratum radiatum interneurons, whereas in stratum lucidum interneurons only GABAergic responses were potentiated. We here disclose that the corelease of glutamate and GABA, as well as their plasticity are compartmentalized in a target-dependent manner, showing counterbalanced compensatory plasticity of two neurotransmitters released by different terminals of the same pathway.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The mossy fibers transiently corelease glutamate and GABA onto pyramidal cells of CA3. We here describe that they can also corelease these amino acids onto interneurons, in a target-dependent manner. Many interneurons in stratum lucidum and stratum radiatum receive both signals, while those in stratum lacunosum-moleculare exclusively receive a glutamatergic signal. It is noteworthy that glutamatergic LTD, which is known to exist on stratum lucidum interneurons, coexists in the same pathway with a presynaptic form of GABAergic LTP, while interneurons of stratum radiatum, despite receiving this dual signaling, do not display such plasticity. The GABAergic LTP is mimicked with PKA or PKC activation. We disclose compartmentalized corelease of glutamate and GABA and its differential plasticity from a single pathway onto different interneuron sets.</p>

            <p>DNA methylation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic pain. However, the specific genes regulated by DNA methylation under neuropathic pain condition remain largely unknown. Here we investigated how chemokine receptor CXCR3 is regulated by DNA methylation and how it contributes to neuropathic pain induced by spinal nerve ligation (SNL) in mice. SNL increased <i>Cxcr3</i> mRNA and protein expression in the neurons of the spinal cord. Meanwhile, the CpG (5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3') island in the <i>Cxcr3</i> gene promoter region was demethylated, and the expression of DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) was decreased. SNL also increased the binding of CCAAT (cytidine–cytidine–adenosine–adenosine–thymidine)/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) with <i>Cxcr3</i> promoter and decreased the binding of DNMT3b with <i>Cxcr3</i> promoter in the spinal cord. C/EBPα expression was increased in spinal neurons after SNL, and inhibition of C/EBPα by intrathecal small interfering RNA attenuated SNL-induced pain hypersensitivity and reduced <i>Cxcr3</i> expression. Furthermore, SNL-induced mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia were markedly reduced in <i>Cxcr3</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice. Spinal inhibition of <i>Cxcr3</i> by shRNA or CXCR3 antagonist also attenuated established neuropathic pain. Moreover, CXCL10, the ligand of CXCR3, was increased in spinal neurons and astrocytes after SNL. Superfusing spinal cord slices with CXCL10 enhanced spontaneous EPSCs and potentiated NMDA-induced and AMPA-induced currents of lamina II neurons. Finally, intrathecal injection of CXCL10 induced CXCR3-dependent pain hypersensitivity in naive mice. Collectively, our results demonstrated that CXCR3, increased by DNA demethylation and the enhanced interaction with C/EBPα, can be activated by CXCL10 to facilitate excitatory synaptic transmission and contribute to the maintenance of neuropathic pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Peripheral nerve injury induces changes of gene expression in the spinal cord that may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. CXCR3 is a chemokine receptor. Whether it is involved in neuropathic pain and how it is regulated after nerve injury remain largely unknown. Our study demonstrates that spinal nerve ligation downregulates the expression of DNMT3b, which may cause demethylation of <i>Cxcr3</i> gene promoter and facilitate the binding of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α with <i>Cxcr3</i> promoter and further increase CXCR3 expression in spinal neurons. The upregulated CXCR3 may contribute to neuropathic pain by facilitating central sensitization. Our study reveals an epigenetic mechanism underlying CXCR3 expression and also suggests that targeting the expression or activation of CXCR3 signaling may offer new therapeutics for neuropathic pain.</p>

            <p>Expectation of reward can be shaped by the observation of actions and expressions of other people in one's environment. A person's apparent confidence in the likely reward of an action, for instance, makes qualities of their evidence, not observed directly, socially accessible. This strategy is computationally distinguished from associative learning methods that rely on direct observation, by its use of inference from indirect evidence. In twenty-three healthy human subjects, we isolated effects of first-hand experience, other people's choices, and the mediating effect of their confidence, on decision-making and neural correlates of value within ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Value derived from first-hand experience and other people's choices (regardless of confidence) were indiscriminately represented across vmPFC. However, value computed from agent choices weighted by their associated confidence was represented with specificity for ventromedial area 10. This pattern corresponds to shifts of connectivity and overlapping cognitive processes along a posterior-anterior vmPFC axis. Task behavior and self-reported self-reliance for decision-making in other social contexts correlated. The tendency to conform in other social contexts corresponded to increased activation in cortical regions previously shown to respond to social conflict in proportion to subsequent conformity (Campbell-Meiklejohn et al., 2010). The tendency to self-monitor predicted a selectively enhanced response to accordance with others in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ). The findings anatomically decompose vmPFC value representations according to computational requirements and provide biological insight into the social transmission of preference and reassurance gained from the confidence of others.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Decades of research have provided evidence that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) signals the satisfaction we expect from imminent actions. However, we have a surprisingly modest understanding of the organization of value across this substantial and varied region. This study finds that using cues of the reliability of other peoples' knowledge to enhance expectation of personal success generates value correlates that are anatomically distinct from those concurrently computed from direct, personal experience. This suggests that representation of decision values in vmPFC is suborganized according to the underlying computation, consistent with what we know about the anatomical heterogeneity of the region. These results also provide insight into the observational learning process by which someone else's confidence can sway and reassure our choices.</p>

            <p>Neuronal activity plays a key role in the development of sensory circuits in the mammalian brain. In the gustatory system, experimental manipulations now exist, through genetic manipulations of specific taste transduction processes, to examine how specific taste qualities (i.e., basic tastes) impact the functional and structural development of gustatory circuits. Here, we used a mouse knock-out model in which the transduction component used to discriminate sodium salts from other taste stimuli was deleted in taste bud cells throughout development. We used this model to test the hypothesis that the lack of activity elicited by sodium salt taste impacts the terminal field organization of nerves that carry taste information from taste buds to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST) in the medulla. The glossopharyngeal, chorda tympani, and greater superficial petrosal nerves were labeled to examine their terminal fields in adult control mice and in adult mice in which the α-subunit of the epithelial sodium channel was conditionally deleted in taste buds (αENaC knockout). The terminal fields of all three nerves in the NST were up to 2.7 times greater in αENaC knock-out mice compared with the respective field volumes in control mice. The shapes of the fields were similar between the two groups; however, the density and spread of labels were greater in αENaC knock-out mice. Overall, our results show that disruption of the afferent taste signal to sodium salts disrupts the normal age-dependent "pruning" of all terminal fields, which could lead to alterations in sensory coding and taste-related behaviors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neural activity plays a major role in the development of sensory circuits in the mammalian brain. To date, there has been no direct test of whether taste-elicited neural activity has a role in shaping central gustatory circuits. However, recently developed genetic tools now allow an assessment of how specific taste stimuli, in this case sodium salt taste, play a role in the maturation of the terminal fields in the mouse brainstem. We found that the specific deletion of sodium salt taste during development produced terminal fields in adults that were dramatically larger than in control mice, demonstrating for the first time that sodium salt taste-elicited activity is necessary for the normal maturation of gustatory inputs into the brain.</p>

            <p>Neurons in primate inferotemporal cortex (IT) are clustered into patches of shared image preferences. Functional imaging has shown that these patches are activated by natural categories (e.g., faces, body parts, and places), artificial categories (numerals, words) and geometric features (curvature and real-world size). These domains develop in the same cortical locations across monkeys and humans, which raises the possibility of common innate mechanisms. Although these commonalities could be high-level template-based categories, it is alternatively possible that the domain locations are constrained by low-level properties such as end-stopping, eccentricity, and the shape of the preferred images. To explore this, we looked for correlations among curvature preference, receptive field (RF) end-stopping, and RF eccentricity in the ventral stream. We recorded from sites in V1, V4, and posterior IT (PIT) from six monkeys using microelectrode arrays. Across all visual areas, we found a tendency for end-stopped sites to prefer curved over straight contours. Further, we found a progression in population curvature preferences along the visual hierarchy, where, on average, V1 sites preferred straight Gabors, V4 sites preferred curved stimuli, and many PIT sites showed a preference for curvature that was concave relative to fixation. Our results provide evidence that high-level functional domains may be mapped according to early rudimentary properties of the visual system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The macaque occipitotemporal cortex contains clusters of neurons with preferences for categories such as faces, body parts, and places. One common question is how these clusters (or "domains") acquire their cortical position along the ventral stream. We and other investigators previously established an fMRI-level correlation among these category domains, retinotopy, and curvature preferences: for example, in inferotemporal cortex, face- and curvature-preferring domains show a central visual field bias whereas place- and rectilinear-preferring domains show a more peripheral visual field bias. Here, we have found an electrophysiological-level explanation for the correlation among domain preference, curvature, and retinotopy based on neuronal preference for short over long contours, also called end-stopping.</p>

            <p>Neuroinflammation is an important contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, as underscored by the recent identification of immune-related genetic risk factors for AD, including coding variants in the gene <i>TREM2</i> (<i>triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2</i>). Understanding TREM2 function promises to provide important insights into how neuroinflammation contributes to AD pathology. However, studies so far have produced seemingly conflicting results, with reports that amyloid pathology can be both decreased and increased in TREM2-deficient AD mouse models. In this study, we unify these previous findings by demonstrating that TREM2 deficiency ameliorates amyloid pathology early, but exacerbates it late in disease progression in the APPPS1–21 mouse model of AD. We also demonstrate that TREM2 deficiency decreases plaque-associated myeloid cell accumulation by reducing cell proliferation, specifically late in pathology. In addition, TREM2 deficiency reduces myeloid cell internalization of amyloid throughout pathology, but decreases inflammation-related gene transcript levels selectively late in disease progression. Together, these results suggest that TREM2 plays distinct functional roles at different stages in AD pathology.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and there are currently no effective treatments that modify disease progression. However, the recent identification of genetic risk factors for AD promises to provide new insight into AD biology and possible new therapeutic targets. Among these risk factors, variants in the gene <i>TREM2</i> (<i>triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2</i>) confer greatly elevated risk for developing the disease. We demonstrate that TREM2 deficiency has opposing effects on AD-related pathologies at early and late stages of disease progression, unifying previous work in the field. In addition, we examine how TREM2 affects the function of the brain immune cell populations in which it is expressed throughout disease progression to understand possible mechanisms underlying its differential impacts on pathology.</p>

            <p>The rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) is a relay in the descending pain modulatory system and an important site of endocannabinoid modulation of pain. Endocannabinoids inhibit GABA release in the RVM, but it is not known whether this effect persists in chronic pain states. In the present studies, persistent inflammation induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) increased GABAergic miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs). Endocannabinoid activation of cannabinoid (CB1) receptors known to inhibit presynaptic GABA release was significantly reduced in the RVM of CFA-treated rats compared with naive rats. The reduction in CFA-treated rats correlated with decreased CB1 receptor protein expression and function in the RVM. Paradoxically, the nonselective CB1/CB2 receptor agonist WIN55212 inhibited GABAergic mIPSCs in both naive and CFA-treated rats. However, WIN55212 inhibition was reversed by the CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant in naive rats but not in CFA-treated rats. WIN55212-mediated inhibition in CFA-treated rats was blocked by the CB2 receptor-selective antagonist SR144528, indicating that CB2 receptor function in the RVM is increased during persistent inflammation. Consistent with these results, CB2 receptor agonists AM1241 and GW405833 inhibited GABAergic mIPSC frequency only in CFA-treated rats, and the inhibition was reversed with SR144528. When administered alone, SR144528 and another CB2 receptor-selective antagonist AM630 increased mIPSC frequency in the RVM of CFA-treated rats, indicating that CB2 receptors are tonically activated by endocannabinoids. Our data provide evidence that CB2 receptor function emerges in the RVM in persistent inflammation and that selective CB2 receptor agonists may be useful for treatment of persistent inflammatory pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> These studies demonstrate that endocannabinoid signaling to CB1 and CB2 receptors in adult rostral ventromedial medulla is altered in persistent inflammation. The emergence of CB2 receptor function in the rostral ventromedial medulla provides additional rationale for the development of CB2 receptor-selective agonists as useful therapeutics for chronic inflammatory pain.</p>

            <p>Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are frequently divided into functional types by their ability to extract and relay specific features from a visual scene, such as the capacity to discern local or global motion, direction of motion, stimulus orientation, contrast or uniformity, or the presence of large or small objects. Here we introduce three previously uncharacterized, nondirection-selective ON–OFF RGC types that represent a distinct set of feature detectors in the mouse retina. The three high-definition (HD) RGCs possess small receptive-field centers and strong surround suppression. They respond selectively to objects of specific sizes, speeds, and types of motion. We present comprehensive morphological characterization of the HD RGCs and physiological recordings of their light responses, receptive-field size and structure, and synaptic mechanisms of surround suppression. We also explore the similarities and differences between the HD RGCs and a well characterized RGC with a comparably small receptive field, the local edge detector, in response to moving objects and textures. We model populations of each RGC type to study how they differ in their performance tracking a moving object. These results, besides introducing three new RGC types that together constitute a substantial fraction of mouse RGCs, provide insights into the role of different circuits in shaping RGC receptive fields and establish a foundation for continued study of the mechanisms of surround suppression and the neural basis of motion detection.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The output cells of the retina, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), are a diverse group of ~40 distinct neuron types that are often assigned "feature detection" profiles based on the specific aspects of the visual scene to which they respond. Here we describe, for the first time, morphological and physiological characterization of three new RGC types in the mouse retina, substantially augmenting our understanding of feature selectivity. Experiments and modeling show that while these three "high-definition" RGCs share certain receptive-field properties, they also have distinct tuning to the size, speed, and type of motion on the retina, enabling them to occupy different niches in stimulus space.</p>

            <p>Eye movements serve to accumulate information from the visual world, contributing to the formation of coherent memory representations that support cognition and behavior. The hippocampus and the oculomotor network are well connected anatomically through an extensive set of polysynaptic pathways. However, the extent to which visual sampling behavior is related to functional responses in the hippocampus during encoding has not been studied directly in human neuroimaging. In the current study, participants engaged in a face processing task while brain responses were recorded with fMRI and eye movements were monitored simultaneously. The number of gaze fixations that a participant made on a given trial was correlated significantly with hippocampal activation such that more fixations were associated with stronger hippocampal activation. Similar results were also found in the fusiform face area, a face-selective perceptual processing region. Notably, the number of fixations was associated with stronger hippocampal activation when the presented faces were novel, but not when the faces were repeated. Increases in fixations during viewing of novel faces also led to larger repetition-related suppression in the hippocampus, indicating that this fixation–hippocampal relationship may reflect the ongoing development of lasting representations. Together, these results provide novel empirical support for the idea that visual exploration and hippocampal binding processes are inherently linked.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The hippocampal and oculomotor networks have each been studied extensively for their roles in the binding of information and gaze function, respectively. Despite the evidence that individuals with amnesia whose damage includes the hippocampus show alterations in their eye movement patterns and recent findings that the two systems are anatomically connected, it has not been demonstrated whether visual exploration is related to hippocampal activity in neurologically intact adults. In this combined fMRI–eye-tracking study, we show how hippocampal responses scale with the number of gaze fixations made during viewing of novel, but not repeated, faces. These findings provide new evidence suggesting that the hippocampus plays an important role in the binding of information, as sampled by gaze fixations, during visual exploration.</p>

            <p>Despite extensive studies in hippocampal slices and incentive from computational theories, the synaptic mechanisms underlying information transfer at mossy fiber (mf) connections between the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 neurons <i>in vivo</i> are still elusive. Here we used an optogenetic approach in mice to selectively target and control the activity of DG granule cells (GCs) while performing whole-cell and juxtacellular recordings of CA3 neurons <i>in vivo</i>. In CA3 pyramidal cells (PCs), mf–CA3 synaptic responses consisted predominantly of an IPSP at low stimulation frequency (0.05 Hz). Upon increasing the frequency of stimulation, a biphasic response was observed consisting of a brief mf EPSP followed by an inhibitory response lasting on the order of 100 ms. Spike transfer at DG–CA3 interneurons recorded in the juxtacellular mode was efficient at low presynaptic stimulation frequency and appeared insensitive to an increased frequency of GC activity. Overall, this resulted in a robust and slow feedforward inhibition of spike transfer at mf–CA3 pyramidal cell synapses. Short-term plasticity of EPSPs with increasing frequency of presynaptic activity allowed inhibition to be overcome to reach spike discharge in CA3 PCs. Whereas the activation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors was responsible for the direct inhibition of light-evoked spike responses, the slow inhibition of spiking activity required the activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in CA3 PCs. The slow inhibitory response defined an optimum frequency of presynaptic activity for spike transfer at ~10 Hz. Altogether these properties define the temporal rules for efficient information transfer at DG–CA3 synaptic connections in the intact circuit.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength constitute a basic mechanism for memory. Synapses from the dentate gyrus (DG) to the CA3 area of the hippocampus are distinctive for their prominent short-term plasticity, as studied in slices. Plasticity of DG–CA3 connections may assist in the encoding of precise memory in the CA3 network. Here we characterize DG–CA3 synaptic transmission <i>in vivo</i> using targeted optogenetic activation of DG granule cells while recording in whole-cell patch-clamp and juxtacellular configuration from CA3 pyramidal cells and interneurons. We show that, <i>in vivo</i>, short-term plasticity of excitatory inputs to CA3 pyramidal cells combines with robust feedforward inhibition mediated by both GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors to control the efficacy and temporal rules for information transfer at DG–CA3 connections.</p>

            <p>KCNQ2 potassium channels are critical for normal brain function, as both loss-of-function and gain-of-function KCNQ2 variants can lead to various forms of neonatal epilepsy. Despite recent progress, the full spectrum of consequences as a result of KCNQ2 dysfunction in neocortical pyramidal neurons is still unknown. Here, we report that conditional ablation of <i>Kcnq2</i> from mouse neocortex leads to hyperexcitability of layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons, exhibiting an increased input resistance and action potential frequency, as well as a reduced medium afterhyperpolarization (mAHP), a conductance partly mediated by KCNQ2 channels. Importantly, we show that introducing the KCNQ2 loss-of-function variant KCNQ2<sup>I205V</sup> into L2/3 pyramidal neurons using <i>in utero</i> electroporation also results in a hyperexcitable phenotype similar to the conditional knock-out. KCNQ2<sup>I205V</sup> has a right-shifted conductance-to-voltage relationship, suggesting loss of KCNQ2 channel activity at subthreshold membrane potentials is sufficient to drive large changes in L2/3 pyramidal neuronal excitability even in the presence of an intact mAHP. We also found that the changes in excitability following <i>Kcnq2</i> ablation are accompanied by alterations at action potential properties, including action potential amplitude in <i>Kcnq2</i>-null neurons. Importantly, partial inhibition of Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 channels was sufficient to counteract the hyperexcitability of <i>Kcnq2</i>-null neurons. Therefore, our work shows that loss of KCNQ2 channels alters the intrinsic neuronal excitability and action potential properties of L2/3 pyramidal neurons, and identifies Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 as a new potential molecular target to reduce excitability in patients with KCNQ2 encephalopathy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> KCNQ2 channels are critical for the development of normal brain function, as KCNQ2 variants could lead to epileptic encephalopathy. However, the role of KCNQ2 channels in regulating the properties of neocortical neurons is largely unexplored. Here, we find that <i>Kcnq2</i> ablation or loss-of-function at subthreshold membrane potentials leads to increased neuronal excitability of neocortical layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons. We also demonstrate that <i>Kcnq2</i> ablation unexpectedly leads to a larger action potential amplitude. Importantly, we propose the Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 channel as a new molecular target for patients with KCNQ2 encephalopathy, as partial inhibition of these channels counteracts the increased L2/3 pyramidal neuron hyperexcitability of <i>Kcnq2</i>-null neurons.</p>

            <p>How neural specificity for distinct conceptual knowledge categories arises is central for understanding the organization of semantic memory in the human brain. Although there is a large body of research on the neural processing of distinct object categories, the organization of action categories remains largely unknown. In particular, it is unknown whether different action categories follow a specific topographical organization on the cortical surface analogously to the category-specific organization of object knowledge. Here, we tested whether the neural representation of action knowledge is organized in terms of nonsocial versus social and object-unrelated versus object-related actions (sociality and transitivity, respectively, hereafter). We hypothesized a major distinction of sociality and transitivity along dorsal and ventral lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC), respectively. Using fMRI-based multivoxel pattern analysis, we identified neural representations of action information associated with sociality and transitivity in bilateral LOTC. Representational similarity analysis revealed a dissociation between dorsal and ventral LOTC. We found that action representations in dorsal LOTC are segregated along features of sociality, whereas action representations in ventral LOTC are segregated along features of transitivity. In addition, representations of sociality and transitivity features were found more anteriorly in LOTC than representations of specific subtypes of actions, suggesting a posterior–anterior gradient from concrete to abstract action features. These findings elucidate how the neural representations of perceptually and conceptually diverse actions are organized in distinct subsystems in the LOTC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) is critically involved in the recognition of objects and actions, but our knowledge about the underlying organizing principles is limited. Here, we discovered a dorsal–ventral distinction of actions in LOTC: dorsal LOTC represents actions based on sociality (how much an action is directed to another person) in proximity to person knowledge. In contrast, ventral LOTC represents actions based on transitivity (how much an action involves the interaction with inanimate objects) in proximity to tools/artifacts in ventral LOTC, suggesting a mutually dependent organization of actions and objects. In addition, we found a posterior-to-anterior organization of the LOTC for concrete and abstract representations, respectively. Our findings provide important insights about the organization of actions in LOTC.</p>

            <p>MicroRNAs (miRNA) play an important role in post-transcriptional gene regulation of several physiological and pathological processes. In multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory and degenerative disease of the CNS, and in its mouse model, the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), miRNA dysregulation has been mainly related to immune system dysfunction and white matter (WM) pathology. However, little is known about their role in gray matter pathology. Here, we explored miRNA involvement in the inflammation-driven alterations of synaptic structure and function, collectively known as synaptopathy, a neuropathological process contributing to excitotoxic neurodegeneration in MS/EAE. Particularly, we observed that miR-142-3p is increased in the CSF of patients with active MS and in EAE brains. We propose miR-142-3p as a molecular mediator of the IL-1β-dependent downregulation of the glial glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST), which causes an enhancement of the glutamatergic transmission in the EAE cerebellum. The synaptic abnormalities mediated by IL-1β and the clinical and neuropathological manifestations of EAE disappeared in <i>miR-142</i> knock-out mice. Furthermore, we observed that <i>in vivo</i> miR-142-3p inhibition, either by a preventive and local treatment or by a therapeutic and systemic strategy, abolished IL-1β- and GLAST-dependent synaptopathy in EAE wild-type mice. Consistently, miR-142-3p was responsible for the glutamatergic synaptic alterations caused by CSF of patients with MS, and CSF levels of miR-142-3p correlated with prospective MS disease progression. Our findings highlight miR-142-3p as key molecular player in IL-1β-mediated synaptic dysfunction, possibly leading to excitotoxic damage in both EAE and MS diseases. Inhibition of miR-142-3p could be neuroprotective in MS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Current studies suggest the role of glutamate excitotoxicity in the development and progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) and of its mouse model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The molecular mechanisms linking inflammation and synaptic alterations in MS/EAE are still unknown. Here, we identified miR-142-3p as a determinant molecular actor in inflammation-dependent synaptopathy typical of both MS and EAE. miR-142-3p was upregulated in the CSF of MS patients and in EAE cerebellum. Inhibition of miR-142-3p, locally in EAE brain and in a MS chimeric <i>ex vivo</i> model, recovered glutamatergic synaptic enhancement typical of EAE/MS. We proved that miR-142-3p promoted the IL-1β-dependent glutamate dysfunction by targeting glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST), a crucial glial transporter involved in glutamate homeostasis. Finally, we suggest miR-142-3p as a negative prognostic factor in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.</p>

            <p>Reward motivation has been demonstrated to enhance declarative memory by facilitating systems-level consolidation. Although high-reward information is often intermixed with lower reward information during an experience, memory for high value information is prioritized. How is this selectivity achieved? One possibility is that postencoding consolidation processes bias memory strengthening to those representations associated with higher reward. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the influence of differential reward motivation on the selectivity of postencoding markers of systems-level memory consolidation. Human participants encoded intermixed, trial-unique memoranda that were associated with either high or low-value during fMRI acquisition. Encoding was interleaved with periods of rest, allowing us to investigate experience-dependent changes in connectivity as they related to later memory. Behaviorally, we found that reward motivation enhanced 24 h associative memory. Analysis of patterns of postencoding connectivity showed that, even though learning trials were intermixed, there was significantly greater connectivity with regions of high-level, category-selective visual cortex associated with high-reward trials. Specifically, increased connectivity of category-selective visual cortex with both the VTA and the anterior hippocampus predicted associative memory for high- but not low-reward memories. Critically, these results were independent of encoding-related connectivity and univariate activity measures. Thus, these findings support a model by which the selective stabilization of memories for salient events is supported by postencoding interactions with sensory cortex associated with reward.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reward motivation is thought to promote memory by supporting memory consolidation. Yet, little is known as to how brain selects relevant information for subsequent consolidation based on reward. We show that experience-dependent changes in connectivity of both the anterior hippocampus and the VTA with high-level visual cortex selectively predicts memory for high-reward memoranda at a 24 h delay. These findings provide evidence for a novel mechanism guiding the consolidation of memories for valuable events, namely, postencoding interactions between neural systems supporting mesolimbic dopamine activation, episodic memory, and perception.</p>

            <p>Methyl-CpG-binding domain 1 (MBD1) belongs to a family of methyl-CpG-binding proteins that are epigenetic "readers" linking DNA methylation to transcriptional regulation. MBD1 is expressed in neural stem cells residing in the dentate gyrus of the adult hippocampus (aNSCs) and MBD1 deficiency leads to reduced neuronal differentiation, impaired neurogenesis, learning deficits, and autism-like behaviors in mice; however, the precise function of MBD1 in aNSCs remains unexplored. Here, we show that MBD1 is important for maintaining the integrity and stemness of NSCs, which is critical for their ability to generate neurons. MBD1 deficiency leads to the accumulation of undifferentiated NSCs and impaired transition into the neuronal lineage. Transcriptome analysis of neural stem and progenitor cells isolated directly from the dentate gyrus of MBD1 mutant (KO) and WT mice showed that gene sets related to cell differentiation, particularly astrocyte lineage genes, were upregulated in KO cells. We further demonstrated that, in NSCs, MBD1 binds and represses directly specific genes associated with differentiation. Our results suggest that MBD1 maintains the multipotency of NSCs by restraining the onset of differentiation genes and that untimely expression of these genes in MBD1-deficient stem cells may interfere with normal cell lineage commitment and cause the accumulation of undifferentiated cells. Our data reveal a novel role for MBD1 in stem cell maintenance and provide insight into how epigenetic regulation contributes to adult neurogenesis and the potential impact of its dysregulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) in the hippocampus self-renew and generate neurons throughout life. We show that methyl-CpG-binding domain 1 (MBD1), a DNA methylation "reader," is important for maintaining the integrity of NSCs, which is critical for their neurogenic potency. Our data reveal a novel role for MBD1 in stem cell maintenance and provide insight into how epigenetic regulation preserves the multipotency of stem cells for subsequent differentiation.</p>

            <p>Neural representations of approximate numerical value, or numerosity, have been observed in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) in monkeys and humans, including children. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that children as young as 3–4 years old exhibit neural tuning to cardinal numerosities in the IPS and that their neural responses are accounted for by a model of numerosity coding that has been used to explain neural responses in the adult IPS. We also found that the sensitivity of children's neural tuning to number in the right IPS was comparable to their numerical discrimination sensitivity observed behaviorally, outside of the scanner. Children's neural tuning curves in the right IPS were significantly sharper than in the left IPS, indicating that numerical representations are more precise and mature more rapidly in the right hemisphere than in the left. Further, we show that children's perceptual sensitivity to numerosity can be predicted by the development of their neural sensitivity to numerosity. This research provides novel evidence of developmental continuity in the neural code underlying numerical representation and demonstrates that children's neural sensitivity to numerosity is related to their cognitive development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here we test for the existence of neural tuning to numerosity in the developing brain in the youngest sample of children tested with fMRI to date. Although previous research shows evidence of numerical distance effects in the intraparietal sulcus of the developing brain, those effects could be explained by patterns of neural activity that do not represent neural tuning to numerosity. These data provide the first robust evidence that from as early as 3–4 years of age there is developmental continuity in how the intraparietal sulcus represents the values of numerosities. Moreover, the study goes beyond previous research by examining the relation between neural tuning and perceptual tuning in children.</p>

            <p>Distinct networks in the forebrain and the midbrain coordinate to control spatial attention. The critical involvement of the superior colliculus (SC)—the central structure in the midbrain network—in visuospatial attention has been shown by four seminal, published studies in monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) performing multialternative tasks. However, due to the lack of a mechanistic framework for interpreting behavioral data in such tasks, the nature of the SC's contribution to attention remains unclear. Here we present and validate a novel decision framework for analyzing behavioral data in multialternative attention tasks. We apply this framework to re-examine the behavioral evidence from these published studies. Our model is a multidimensional extension to signal detection theory that distinguishes between two major classes of attentional mechanisms: those that alter the quality of sensory information or "sensitivity," and those that alter the selective gating of sensory information or "choice bias." Model-based simulations and model-based analyses of data from these published studies revealed a converging pattern of results that indicated that choice-bias changes, rather than sensitivity changes, were the primary outcome of SC manipulation. Our results suggest that the SC contributes to attentional performance predominantly by generating a spatial choice bias for stimuli at a selected location, and that this bias operates downstream of forebrain mechanisms that enhance sensitivity. The findings lead to a testable mechanistic framework of how the midbrain and forebrain networks interact to control spatial attention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Attention involves the selection of the most relevant information for differential sensory processing and decision making. While the mechanisms by which attention alters sensory encoding (sensitivity control) are well studied, the mechanisms by which attention alters decisional weighting of sensory evidence (choice-bias control) are poorly understood. Here, we introduce a model of multialternative decision making that distinguishes bias from sensitivity effects in attention tasks. With our model, we simulate experimental data from four seminal studies that microstimulated or inactivated a key attention-related midbrain structure, the superior colliculus (SC). We demonstrate that the experimental effects of SC manipulation are entirely consistent with the SC controlling attention by changing choice bias, thereby shedding new light on how the brain mediates attention.</p>

            <p>The fundamental metabolic decision of a cell, the balance between respiration and fermentation, rests in part on expression of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) and coordination with expression of the nuclear genome (nuDNA). Previously we described mtDNA copy number depletion across many solid tumor types (Reznik et al., 2016). Here, we use orthogonal RNA-sequencing data to quantify mtDNA expression (mtRNA), and report analogously lower expression of mtRNA in tumors (relative to normal tissue) across a majority of cancer types. Several cancers exhibit a trio of mutually consistent evidence suggesting a drop in respiratory activity: depletion of mtDNA copy number, decreases in mtRNA levels, and decreases in expression of nuDNA-encoded respiratory proteins. Intriguingly, a minority of cancer types exhibit a drop in mtDNA expression but an increase in nuDNA expression of respiratory proteins, with unknown implications for respiratory activity. Our results indicate suppression of respiratory gene expression across many cancer types.</p>

            <p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease. Although many patients with asthma develop type-2 dominated eosinophilic inflammation, a number of individuals develop paucigranulocytic asthma, which occurs in the absence of eosinophilia or neutrophilia. The aetiology of paucigranulocytic asthma is unknown. However, both respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and mutations in the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (<em>RAGE</em>) are risk factors for asthma development. Here, we show that RAGE deficiency impairs anti-viral immunity during an early-life infection with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM; a murine analogue of RSV). The elevated viral load was associated with the release of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) which triggered airway smooth muscle remodelling in early-life. Re-infection with PVM in later-life induced many of the cardinal features of asthma in the absence of eosinophilic or neutrophilic inflammation. Anti-HMGB1 mitigated both early-life viral disease and asthma-like features, highlighting HMGB1 as a possible novel therapeutic target.</p>

            <p>To study the molecular basis for predator-prey coevolution, we investigated how <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> responds to the predatory fungus <em>Arthrobotrys oligospora</em>. <em>C. elegans</em> and other nematodes were attracted to volatile compounds produced by <em>A. oligospora</em>. Gas-chromatographic mass-spectral analyses of <em>A. oligospora</em>-derived volatile metabolites identified several odors mimicking food cues attractive to nematodes. One compound, methyl 3-methyl-2-butenoate (MMB) additionally triggered strong sex- and stage-specific attraction in several <em>Caenorhabditis</em> species. Furthermore, when MMB is present, it interferes with nematode mating, suggesting that MMB might mimic sex pheromone in <em>Caenorhabditis</em> species. Forward genetic screening suggests that multiple receptors are involved in sensing MMB. Response to fungal odors involves the olfactory neuron AWCs. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed the GPCRs expressed in AWC. We propose that <em>A. oligospora</em> likely evolved the means to use olfactory mimicry to attract its nematode prey through the olfactory neurons in <em>C. elegans</em> and related species.</p>

            <p>by Bethany Levick, Andy South, Ian M. Hastings</p>

We develop a flexible, two-locus model for the spread of insecticide resistance applicable to mosquito species that transmit human diseases such as malaria. The model allows differential exposure of males and females, allows them to encounter high or low concentrations of insecticide, and allows selection pressures and dominance values to differ depending on the concentration of insecticide encountered. We demonstrate its application by investigating the relative merits of sequential use of insecticides versus their deployment as a mixture to minimise the spread of resistance. We recover previously published results as subsets of this model and conduct a sensitivity analysis over an extensive parameter space to identify what circumstances favour mixtures over sequences. Both strategies lasted more than 500 mosquito generations (or about 40 years) in 24% of runs, while in those runs where resistance had spread to high levels by 500 generations, 56% favoured sequential use and 44% favoured mixtures. Mixtures are favoured when insecticide effectiveness (their ability to kill homozygous susceptible mosquitoes) is high and exposure (the proportion of mosquitoes that encounter the insecticide) is low. If insecticides do not reliably kill homozygous sensitive genotypes, it is likely that sequential deployment will be a more robust strategy. Resistance to an insecticide always spreads slower if that insecticide is used in a mixture although this may be insufficient to outperform sequential use: for example, a mixture may last 5 years while the two insecticides deployed individually may last 3 and 4 years giving an overall ‘lifespan’ of 7 years for sequential use. We emphasise that this paper is primarily about designing and implementing a flexible modelling strategy to investigate the spread of insecticide resistance in vector populations and demonstrate how our model can identify vector control strategies most likely to minimise the spread of insecticide resistance.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AooN0IhJ-YA" width="1" />

            <p>by Aysima Hacisuleyman, Burak Erman</p>

It has recently been proposed by Gunasakaran et al. that allostery may be an intrinsic property of all proteins. Here, we develop a computational method that can determine and quantify allosteric activity in any given protein. Based on Schreiber's transfer entropy formulation, our approach leads to an information transfer landscape for the protein that shows the presence of entropy sinks and sources and explains how pairs of residues communicate with each other using entropy transfer. The model can identify the residues that drive the fluctuations of others. We apply the model to Ubiquitin, whose allosteric activity has not been emphasized until recently, and show that there are indeed systematic pathways of entropy and information transfer between residues that correlate well with the activities of the protein. We use 600 nanosecond molecular dynamics trajectories for Ubiquitin and its complex with human polymerase iota and evaluate entropy transfer between all pairs of residues of Ubiquitin and quantify the binding susceptibility changes upon complex formation. We explain the complex formation propensities of Ubiquitin in terms of entropy transfer. Important residues taking part in allosteric communication in Ubiquitin predicted by our approach are in agreement with results of NMR relaxation dispersion experiments. Finally, we show that time delayed correlation of fluctuations of two interacting residues possesses an intrinsic causality that tells which residue controls the interaction and which one is controlled. Our work shows that time delayed correlations, entropy transfer and causality are the required new concepts for explaining allosteric communication in proteins.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oiuoF2F7qT0" width="1" />

            <p>by Christian Donner, Klaus Obermayer, Hideaki Shimazaki</p>

The models in statistical physics such as an Ising model offer a convenient way to characterize stationary activity of neural populations. Such stationary activity of neurons may be expected for recordings from <i>in vitro</i> slices or anesthetized animals. However, modeling activity of cortical circuitries of awake animals has been more challenging because both spike-rates and interactions can change according to sensory stimulation, behavior, or an internal state of the brain. Previous approaches modeling the dynamics of neural interactions suffer from computational cost; therefore, its application was limited to only a dozen neurons. Here by introducing multiple analytic approximation methods to a state-space model of neural population activity, we make it possible to estimate dynamic pairwise interactions of up to 60 neurons. More specifically, we applied the pseudolikelihood approximation to the state-space model, and combined it with the Bethe or TAP mean-field approximation to make the sequential Bayesian estimation of the model parameters possible. The large-scale analysis allows us to investigate dynamics of macroscopic properties of neural circuitries underlying stimulus processing and behavior. We show that the model accurately estimates dynamics of network properties such as sparseness, entropy, and heat capacity by simulated data, and demonstrate utilities of these measures by analyzing activity of monkey V4 neurons as well as a simulated balanced network of spiking neurons.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gKHENyQceI8" width="1" />

            <p>by Gabrielle Stetz, Gennady M. Verkhivker</p>

Allosteric interactions in the Hsp70 proteins are linked with their regulatory mechanisms and cellular functions. Despite significant progress in structural and functional characterization of the Hsp70 proteins fundamental questions concerning modularity of the allosteric interaction networks and hierarchy of signaling pathways in the Hsp70 chaperones remained largely unexplored and poorly understood. In this work, we proposed an integrated computational strategy that combined atomistic and coarse-grained simulations with coevolutionary analysis and network modeling of the residue interactions. A novel aspect of this work is the incorporation of dynamic residue correlations and coevolutionary residue dependencies in the construction of allosteric interaction networks and signaling pathways. We found that functional sites involved in allosteric regulation of Hsp70 may be characterized by structural stability, proximity to global hinge centers and local structural environment that is enriched by highly coevolving flexible residues. These specific characteristics may be necessary for regulation of allosteric structural transitions and could distinguish regulatory sites from nonfunctional conserved residues. The observed confluence of dynamics correlations and coevolutionary residue couplings with global networking features may determine modular organization of allosteric interactions and dictate localization of key mediating sites. Community analysis of the residue interaction networks revealed that concerted rearrangements of local interacting modules at the inter-domain interface may be responsible for global structural changes and a population shift in the DnaK chaperone. The inter-domain communities in the Hsp70 structures harbor the majority of regulatory residues involved in allosteric signaling, suggesting that these sites could be integral to the network organization and coordination of structural changes. Using a network-based formalism of allostery, we introduced a community-hopping model of allosteric communication. Atomistic reconstruction of signaling pathways in the DnaK structures captured a direction-specific mechanism and molecular details of signal transmission that are fully consistent with the mutagenesis experiments. The results of our study reconciled structural and functional experiments from a network-centric perspective by showing that global properties of the residue interaction networks and coevolutionary signatures may be linked with specificity and diversity of allosteric regulation mechanisms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CXOhA7y81qg" width="1" />

            <p>by Alireza Yazdani, He Li, Jay D. Humphrey, George Em Karniadakis</p>

Modeling the transport, activation, and adhesion of platelets is crucial in predicting thrombus formation and growth following a thrombotic event in normal or pathological conditions. We propose a shear-dependent platelet adhesive model based on the Morse potential that is calibrated by existing <i>in</i> <i>vivo</i> and <i>in</i> <i>vitro</i> experimental data and can be used over a wide range of flow shear rates (100 &lt; γ ˙ &lt; 28 , 000 s - 1). We introduce an Eulerian-Lagrangian model where hemodynamics is solved on a fixed Eulerian grid, while platelets are tracked using a Lagrangian framework. A force coupling method is introduced for bidirectional coupling of platelet motion with blood flow. Further, we couple the calibrated platelet aggregation model with a tissue-factor/contact pathway coagulation cascade, representing the relevant biology of thrombin generation and the subsequent fibrin deposition. The range of shear rates covered by the proposed model encompass venous and arterial thrombosis, ranging from low-shear-rate conditions in abdominal aortic aneurysms and thoracic aortic dissections to thrombosis in stenotic arteries following plaque rupture, where local shear rates are extremely high.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xcg59gCiNuo" width="1" />

            <p>by Christoph Zimmer, Reza Yaesoubi, Ted Cohen</p>

Stochastic transmission dynamic models are especially useful for studying the early emergence of novel pathogens given the importance of chance events when the number of infectious individuals is small. However, methods for parameter estimation and prediction for these types of stochastic models remain limited. In this manuscript, we describe a calibration and prediction framework for stochastic compartmental transmission models of epidemics. The proposed method, Multiple Shooting for Stochastic systems (MSS), applies a linear noise approximation to describe the size of the fluctuations, and uses each new surveillance observation to update the belief about the true epidemic state. Using simulated outbreaks of a novel viral pathogen, we evaluate the accuracy of MSS for real-time parameter estimation and prediction during epidemics. We assume that weekly counts for the number of new diagnosed cases are available and serve as an imperfect proxy of incidence. We show that MSS produces accurate estimates of key epidemic parameters (i.e. mean duration of infectiousness, <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>, and <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>) and can provide an accurate estimate of the unobserved number of infectious individuals during the course of an epidemic. MSS also allows for accurate prediction of the number and timing of future hospitalizations and the overall attack rate. We compare the performance of MSS to three state-of-the-art benchmark methods: 1) a likelihood approximation with an assumption of independent Poisson observations; 2) a particle filtering method; and 3) an ensemble Kalman filter method. We find that MSS significantly outperforms each of these three benchmark methods in the majority of epidemic scenarios tested. In summary, MSS is a promising method that may improve on current approaches for calibration and prediction using stochastic models of epidemics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/U9r8e4DcuH8" width="1" />

            <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: To define the clinical features and biomarkers that predict which patients with pure autonomic failure will develop Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: One hundred patients who presented with pure autonomic failure were recruited at 5 medical centers in the U.S. Seventy-four patients agreed to be followed prospectively. Patients underwent clinical evaluations including neurological rating scales, sleep questionnaires, smell test, and sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular autonomic function tests.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: At enrollment, patients were 68(12) years old [(median (interquartile range)] and had had autonomic failure for 5(7) years. Within 4-years of follow-up, 25 of 74 subjects (34%) developed dementia with Lewy bodies (in 13), Parkinson disease (in 6), or multiple system atrophy (in 6). The presence of probable REM sleep behavior disorder was strongly associated with the development of a manifest CNS synucleinopathy (odds ratio=7.1). Patients who phenoconverted to multiple system atrophy had younger age at onset of autonomic failure, severe bladder/bowel dysfunction, preserved olfaction, and a cardiac chronotrophic response upon tilt &gt;10 beats per minute. Those who phenoconverted to Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy bodies had decreased olfaction, a lesser chronotrophic response to tilt, and a longer duration of illness. The small group of patients retaining the pure autonomic failure phenotype had very low plasma norepinephrine levels, slow resting heart rate, no REM sleep behavior disorder, and preserved smell.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Patients presenting with pure autonomic failure are at high risk of phenoconverting to a manifest CNS synucleinopathy. Specific clinical features predict future diagnosis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

            <p>Injury-induced (Wallerian) axonal degeneration is regulated via the opposing actions of pro-degenerative factors such as SARM1 and a MAPK signal and pro-survival factors, the most important of which is the NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT2 that inhibits activation of the SARM1 pathway. Here we investigate the mechanism by which MAPK signaling facilitates axonal degeneration. We show that MAPK signaling promotes the turnover of the axonal survival factor NMNAT2 in cultured mammalian neurons as well as the <em>Drosophila</em> ortholog dNMNAT in motoneurons. The increased levels of NMNAT2 are required for the axonal protection caused by loss of MAPK signaling. Regulation of NMNAT2 by MAPK signaling does not require SARM1, and so cannot be downstream of SARM1. Hence, pro-degenerative MAPK signaling functions upstream of SARM1 by limiting the levels of the essential axonal survival factor NMNAT2 to promote injury-dependent SARM1 activation. These findings are consistent with a linear molecular pathway for the axonal degeneration program.</p>

            <p>The populations of light-demanding trees that dominate the canopy of central African forests are now aging. Here, we show that the lack of regeneration of these populations began ca. 165 ya (around 1850) after major anthropogenic disturbances ceased. Since 1885, less itinerancy and disturbance in the forest has occurred because the colonial administrations concentrated people and villages along the primary communication axes. Local populations formerly gardened the forest by creating scattered openings, which were sufficiently large for the establishment of light-demanding trees. Currently, common logging operations do not create suitable openings for the regeneration of these species, whereas deforestation degrades landscapes. Using an interdisciplinary approach, which included paleoecological, archaeological, historical, and dendrological data, we highlight the long-term history of human activities across central African forests and assess the contribution of these activities to present-day forest structure and composition. The conclusions of this sobering analysis present challenges to current silvicultural practices and to those of the future.</p>

            <p>In response to environments that cause cellular stress, animals engage in sleep behavior that facilitates recovery from the stress. In <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>, stress-induced sleep(SIS) is regulated by cytokine activation of the ALA neuron, which releases FLP-13 neuropeptides characterized by an amidated arginine-phenylalanine (RFamide) C-terminus motif. By performing an unbiased genetic screen for mutants that impair the somnogenic effects of FLP-13 neuropeptides, we identified the gene <em>dmsr-1</em>, which encodes a G-protein coupled receptor similar to an insect RFamide receptor. DMSR-1 is activated by FLP-13 peptides in cell culture, is required for SIS <em>in vivo</em>, is expressed non-synaptically in several wake-promoting neurons, and likely couples to a Gi/o heterotrimeric G-protein. Our data expand our understanding of how a single neuroendocrine cell coordinates an organism-wide behavioral response, and suggest that similar signaling principles may function in other organisms to regulate sleep during sickness.</p>

            <p>Kinase inhibitors are effective cancer therapies, but tumors frequently develop resistance. Current strategies to circumvent resistance target the same or parallel pathways. We report here that targeting a completely different process, autophagy, can overcome multiple BRAF inhibitor resistance mechanisms in brain tumors. <em>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></em>mutations occur in many pediatric brain tumors. We previously reported that these tumors are autophagy-dependent and a patient was successfully treated with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine after failure of the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitor vemurafenib, suggesting autophagy inhibition overcame the kinase inhibitor resistance. We tested this hypothesis in vemurafenib-resistant brain tumors. Genetic and pharmacological autophagy inhibition overcame molecularly distinct resistance mechanisms, inhibited tumor cell growth, and increased cell death. Patients with resistance had favorable clinical responses when chloroquine was added to vemurafenib. This provides a fundamentally different strategy to circumvent multiple mechanisms of kinase inhibitor resistance that could be rapidly tested in clinical trials in patients with <em>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></em> brain tumors.</p>

            Ghrelin is a multifaceted regulator of metabolism. Ghrelin regulates energy balance in the short term via induction of appetite and in the long term via increased body weight and adiposity. Recently, several central pathways modulating the metabolic actions of ghrelin were unmasked, and it was shown to act through different hypothalamic nuclei to induce feeding. Ghrelin also modulates glucose homeostasis, but the central mechanisms responsible for this action have not been studied in detail. Although ghrelin also acts through extrahypothalamic areas to promote feeding, this review specifically dissects hypothalamic control of ghrelin’s orexigenic and adipogenic actions and presents current understanding of the intracellular ghrelin orexigenic pathways, including their dependence on other relevant systems implicated in energy balance.

            Objectives: To examine the effects of intermittent TBS (iTBS) and continuous TBS (cTBS) on cortical reactivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Methods: 10 healthy participants were stimulated with either iTBS, cTBS or sham at F3 electrode. Single- and paired-pulse TMS and concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) were used to assess change in cortical reactivity and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) via TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) and TMS-evoked oscillations. Results: Significant increases in N120 amplitudes (p &lt; 0.01) were observed following iTBS over prefrontal cortex. Changes in TMS-evoked theta oscillations and LICI of theta oscillations were also observed following iTBS (increase) and cTBS (decrease). Change in LICI of theta oscillations correlated with change in N120 amplitude following TBS (r = -0.670, p = 0.001). Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence that TBS produces direct changes in cortical reactivity in the prefrontal cortex. Combining TBS with TMS-EEG may be a useful approach to optimise stimulation paradigms prior to the conduct of clinical trials. Significance: TBS is able to modulate cortical reactivity and cortical inhibition in the prefrontal cortex.

            Dry ice is commonly used as a cooling agent in the preclinical research environment. It permits rapid freezing of tissues and organs through liquid media. Laboratories depend on a constant supply of dry ice because it disintegrates in a matter of days. Here we tested whether commercially available pebble gravel could be used as dry ice replacement for snap freezing mouse brains in 2-methylbutane. We monitored 2-methylbutane temperature for one hour and tested different setups with the focus on creating a practical solution that can be used in every research laboratory. While gravel pebbles cannot replace dry ice in the laboratory entirely, they present a useful addition as readily available and reusable cooling agent.

            Over recent decades, a growing body of research has accumulated concerning the relationship between indicators of general intelligence and the personality construct known as psychopathy. Both traits represent key correlates of life outcomes, predicting everything from occupational and economic success, to various indicators of prosocial behavior (including avoiding contact with the criminal justice system). The findings to date regarding the association of the two traits, however, have been somewhat inconsistent. Thus, there remains a need for a more systematic investigation of the extant empirical literature. The current study reports a meta-analysis conducted to evaluate the direction and overall effect size of the relationship between these two constructs. Our analyses revealed a small, but significant, negative effect of intelligence on psychopathy. The results and impact of possible moderating variables such as type of intelligence test used are discussed. Finally, the study limitations, and possible directions for further research on this issue are detailed prior to concluding.

            Previous studies suggest that factual learning, that is, learning from obtained outcomes, is biased, such that participants preferentially take into account positive, as compared to negative, prediction errors. However, whether or not the prediction error valence also affects counterfactual learning, that is, learning from forgone outcomes, is unknown. To address this question, we analysed the performance of two cohorts of participants on reinforcement learning tasks using a computational model that was adapted to test if prediction error valance influences learning. Concerning factual learning, we replicated previous findings of a valence-induced bias, whereby participants learned preferentially from positive, relative to negative, prediction errors. In contrast, for counterfactual learning, we found the opposite valence-induced bias: negative prediction errors were preferentially taken into account relative to positive ones. When considering valence-induced bias in the context of both factual and counterfactual learning, it appears that people tend to preferentially take into account information that confirms their current choice

            Recently, Meyer and Bucci used chemogenetic technology – artificial excitatory and inhibitory receptors – to modulate neuronal activity in two connected brain regions in opposite directions simultaneously. This innovative manipulation revealed that the two regions studied, orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, are not sequentially dependent during contextual decision-making.

            Autism-associated genetic mutations may produce altered learning abilities by perturbing the balance between stability and plasticity of synaptic connections in the brain. Here we report an increase in the stabilization of dendritic spines formed during repetitive motor learning in the mouse model of MECP2-duplication syndrome, a high-penetrance form of syndromic autism. This increased stabilization is mediated entirely by spines that form cooperatively in clusters. The number of clusters formed and stabilized predicts the mutant's enhanced motor learning and memory phenotype, reminiscent of savant-like behaviors occasionally associated with autism. The ERK signaling pathway, which promotes cooperative plasticity between spines, was found to be hyperactive in MECP2-duplication motor cortex specifically after training. Inhibition of ERK signaling normalizes clustered spine stabilization and rescues motor learning behavior in mutants. We conclude that learning-associated dendritic spine clustering stabilized by hyperactive ERK signaling drives abnormal motor learning and memory consolidation in this model of syndromic autism.

            Background: Disruption of the synaptic balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) in cortical circuits is a leading hypothesis for pathophysiologies of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. However, it is poorly understood how synaptic E/I disruptions propagate upward to induce cognitive deficits, including impaired decision making (DM). Methods: We investigated how E/I perturbations may impair temporal integration of evidence during perceptual DM in a biophysically-based model of association cortical microcircuits. Using multiple psychophysical task paradigms, we characterized effects of NMDA receptor hypofunction at two key synaptic sites: inhibitory interneurons (elevating E/I ratio, via disinhibition), versus excitatory pyramidal neurons (lowering E/I ratio). Results: Disruption of E/I balance in either direction can similarly impair DM as assessed by psychometric performance, following inverted-U dependence. Nonetheless, these regimes make dissociable predictions for task paradigms that characterize the time course of evidence accumulation. Under elevated E/I ratio, DM is impulsive: evidence early in time is weighted much more than late evidence. In contrast, under lowered E/I ratio, DM is indecisive: evidence integration and winner-take-all competition between options are weakened. These effects are well captured by an extended drift-diffusion model with self-coupling. Conclusions: Our findings characterize critical roles of cortical E/I balance in cognitive functions, the utility of timing-sensitive psychophysical paradigms, and relationships between circuit and psychological models. The model makes specific predictions for behavior and neural activity that are testable in humans or animals under causal manipulations of E/I balance and in disease states.

            Cerebrovascular reactivity mapping (CVR), using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and carbon dioxide as a stimulus, provides useful information on how cerebral blood vessels react under stress. This information has proven to be useful in the study of vascular disorders, dementia and healthy ageing. However, clinical adoption of this form of CVR mapping has been hindered by relatively long scan durations of 7 to 12 minutes. By replacing the conventional block presentation of carbon dioxide enriched air with a sinusoidally modulated stimulus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether more clinically acceptable scan durations are possible. Firstly, the conventional block protocol was compared with a sinusoidal protocol of the same duration of 7 minutes. Estimates of the magnitude of the CVR signal (CVR magnitude) and the relative timing of the CVR response (CVR phase) were found to be in good agreement between the stimulus protocols. Secondly, data from the sinusoidal protocol was reanalysed using decreasing amounts of data in the range 1 to 6 minutes. The CVR magnitude was found to tolerate this reduction in scan duration better than CVR phase. However, these analyses indicate that scan durations in the range of 3 to 5 minutes produce robust data.

            Traversal of a complicated route is often facilitated by considering it as a set of related sub-spaces. Such compartmentalization processes could occur within retrosplenial cortex, a structure whose neurons simultaneously encode position within routes and other spatial coordinate systems. Here, retrosplenial cortex neurons were recorded as rats traversed a track having recurrent structure at multiple scales. Consistent with a major role in compartmentalization of complex routes, individual RSC neurons exhibited periodic activation patterns that repeated across route segments having the same shape. Concurrently, a larger population of RSC neurons exhibited single-cycle periodicity over the full route, effectively defining a framework for encoding of sub-route positions relative to the whole. The same population simultaneously provides a novel metric for distance from each route position to all others. Together, the findings implicate retrosplenial cortex in the extraction of path sub-spaces, the encoding of their spatial relationships to each other, and path integration.

            Simultaneous EEG-fMRI has been vastly used to investigate functional networks of brain combining high spatial resolution (millimeter) of fMRI with high temporal resolution (millisecond) of EEG. However, to extract the most relevant information from the acquired data, it is necessary to develop analysis methods with less ad hoc assumptions. To this end, brain rhythms are often used which are the specific frequency-bands of EEG signal and assumed to represent diverse sub-second cognitive processes at different parts of the cortex. Furthermore, single-trial analysis of EEG is believed to show more realistic picture of ongoing and event-related activities of brain. Here, we present a nonparametric multiple change-point detection and estimation method for the single-trial analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiment recorded during auditory and visual oddball tasks. In a simple attention task like oddball, the frontal cortex of brain is responsible to distinguish and respond appropriately to target versus standard events. By using EEG signal at the frontal cortex, we show that the -band activity changes according to ''inhibition timing'' hypothesis and the {beta}-band activity is in line with ''maintaining the status quo'' hypothesis. Furthermore, using these activities to build regressors in the GLM analysis of fMRI, we localize active brain regions with high spatial and temporal resolutions and elaborate further on the coordination of attentional networks across brain.

            Using a novel fMRI-based inter-subject functional correlation (ISFC) approach, which isolates stimulus-locked inter-regional correlation patterns, we compared the cortical topology of the neural circuit for face processing in participants with congenital prosopagnosia (CP) and matched controls. Whereas the anterior temporal lobe served as the major network hub for face processing in controls, this was not the case for the CPs. Instead, this group evinced hyper-connectivity in posterior regions of the visual cortex, mostly associated with the lateral occipital and the inferior temporal cortices. Moreover, the extent to which the network organization was atypical differed as a function of the severity of the face recognition deficit. These results offer new insights into the perturbed cortical topology in CP, which may serve as the underlying neural basis of the behavioral deficits typical of this disorder. The approach adopted here has the potential to uncover altered topologies in other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well.

            The insect central complex and vertebrate basal ganglia are forebrain centres involved in selection and maintenance of behavioural actions. However, little is known about the formation of the underlying circuits, or how they integrate sensory information for motor actions. Here, we show that paired embryonic neuroblasts generate central complex ring neurons that mediate sensory-motor transformation and action selection in Drosophila. Lineage analysis resolves four ring neuron subtypes, R1-R4, that form GABAergic inhibition circuitry among inhibitory sister cells. Genetic manipulations, together with functional imaging, demonstrate subtype-specific R neurons mediate the selection and maintenance of behavioural activity. A computational model substantiates genetic and behavioural observations suggesting that R neuron circuitry functions as salience detector using competitive inhibition to amplify, maintain or switch between activity states. The resultant gating mechanism translates facilitation, inhibition and disinhibition of behavioural activity as R neuron functions into selection of motor actions and their organisation into action sequences.

            <p>by Yaroslav Pollak, Sarah Goldberg, Roee Amit</p>

We model the regulatory role of proteins bound to looped DNA using a simulation in which dsDNA is represented as a self-avoiding chain, and proteins as spherical protrusions. We simulate long self-avoiding chains using a sequential importance sampling Monte-Carlo algorithm, and compute the probabilities for chain looping with and without a protrusion. We find that a protrusion near one of the chain’s termini reduces the probability of looping, even for chains much longer than the protrusion–chain-terminus distance. This effect increases with protrusion size, and decreases with protrusion-terminus distance. The reduced probability of looping can be explained via an eclipse-like model, which provides a novel inhibitory mechanism. We test the eclipse model on two possible transcription-factor occupancy states of the <i>D. melanogaster</i> <i>eve</i> 3/7 enhancer, and show that it provides a possible explanation for the experimentally-observed <i>eve</i> stripe 3 and 7 expression patterns.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1qZ5ZUvpoZQ" width="1" />

            <p>by Federica Giardina, Ethan Obie Romero-Severson, Jan Albert, Tom Britton, Thomas Leitner</p>

Phylogenetic inference is an attractive means to reconstruct transmission histories and epidemics. However, there is not a perfect correspondence between transmission history and virus phylogeny. Both node height and topological differences may occur, depending on the interaction between within-host evolutionary dynamics and between-host transmission patterns. To investigate these interactions, we added a within-host evolutionary model in epidemiological simulations and examined if the resulting phylogeny could recover different types of contact networks. To further improve realism, we also introduced patient-specific differences in infectivity across disease stages, and on the epidemic level we considered incomplete sampling and the age of the epidemic. Second, we implemented an inference method based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to discriminate among three well-studied network models and jointly estimate both network parameters and key epidemiological quantities such as the infection rate. Our ABC framework used both topological and distance-based tree statistics for comparison between simulated and observed trees. Overall, our simulations showed that a virus time-scaled phylogeny (genealogy) may be substantially different from the between-host transmission tree. This has important implications for the interpretation of what a phylogeny reveals about the underlying epidemic contact network. In particular, we found that while the within-host evolutionary process obscures the transmission tree, the diversification process and infectivity dynamics also add discriminatory power to differentiate between different types of contact networks. We also found that the possibility to differentiate contact networks depends on how far an epidemic has progressed, where distance-based tree statistics have more power early in an epidemic. Finally, we applied our ABC inference on two different outbreaks from the Swedish HIV-1 epidemic.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/irhJOC2fjXk" width="1" />

            <p>by Christopher M. Siwy, Christopher Lockhart, Dmitri K. Klimov</p>

By applying REMD simulations we have performed comparative analysis of the conformational ensembles of amino-truncated A<i>β</i>10-40 peptide produced with five force fields, which combine four protein parameterizations (CHARMM36, CHARMM22*, CHARMM22/cmap, and OPLS-AA) and two water models (standard and modified TIP3P). A<i>β</i>10-40 conformations were analyzed by computing secondary structure, backbone fluctuations, tertiary interactions, and radius of gyration. We have also calculated A<i>β</i>10-40 <sup>3</sup><i>J</i><sub>HNHα</sub>-coupling and RDC constants and compared them with their experimental counterparts obtained for the full-length A<i>β</i>1-40 peptide. Our study led us to several conclusions. First, all force fields predict that A<i>β</i> adopts unfolded structure dominated by turn and random coil conformations. Second, specific TIP3P water model does not dramatically affect secondary or tertiary A<i>β</i>10-40 structure, albeit standard TIP3P model favors slightly more compact states. Third, although the secondary structures observed in CHARMM36 and CHARMM22/cmap simulations are qualitatively similar, their tertiary interactions show little consistency. Fourth, two force fields, OPLS-AA and CHARMM22* have unique features setting them apart from CHARMM36 or CHARMM22/cmap. OPLS-AA reveals moderate <i>β</i>-structure propensity coupled with extensive, but weak long-range tertiary interactions leading to A<i>β</i> collapsed conformations. CHARMM22* exhibits moderate helix propensity and generates multiple exceptionally stable long- and short-range interactions. Our investigation suggests that among all force fields CHARMM22* differs the most from CHARMM36. Fifth, the analysis of <sup>3</sup><i>J</i><sub>HNHα</sub>-coupling and RDC constants based on CHARMM36 force field with standard TIP3P model led us to an unexpected finding that <i>in silico</i> A<i>β</i>10-40 and experimental A<i>β</i>1-40 constants are generally in better agreement than these quantities computed and measured for identical peptides, such as A<i>β</i>1-40 or A<i>β</i>1-42. This observation suggests that the differences in the conformational ensembles of A<i>β</i>10-40 and A<i>β</i>1-40 are small and the former can be used as proxy of the full-length peptide. Based on this argument, we concluded that CHARMM36 force field with standard TIP3P model produces the most accurate representation of A<i>β</i>10-40 conformational ensemble.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_BxEPABbZxg" width="1" />

A promising alternative to address the problem of acquired drug resistance is to rely on combination therapies. Identification of the right combinations is often accomplished through trial and error, a labor and resource intensive process whose scale quickly escalates as more drugs can be combined. To address this problem, we present a broad computational approach for predicting synergistic combinations using easily obtainable single drug efficacy, no detailed mechanistic understanding of drug function, and limited drug combination testing. When applied to mutant BRAF melanoma, we found that our approach exhibited significant predictive power. Additionally, we validated previously untested synergy predictions involving anticancer molecules. As additional large combinatorial screens become available, this methodology could prove to be impactful for identification of drug synergy in context of other types of cancers.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EGO2TQqwWNY" width="1" />

            <p>Neurons face unique challenges of transporting nascent autophagic vacuoles (AVs) from distal axons toward the soma, where mature lysosomes are mainly located. Autophagy defects have been linked to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the mechanisms underlying altered autophagy remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that defective retrograde transport contributes to autophagic stress in AD axons. Amphisomes predominantly accumulate at axonal terminals of mutant hAPP mice and AD patient brains. Amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers associate with AVs in AD axons and interact with dynein motors. This interaction impairs dynein recruitment to amphisomes through competitive interruption of dynein-Snapin motor-adaptor coupling, thus immobilizing them in distal axons. Consistently, deletion of <em>Snapin</em> in mice causes AD-like axonal autophagic stress, whereas overexpressing Snapin in hAPP neurons reduces autophagic accumulation at presynaptic terminals by enhancing AV retrograde transport. Altogether, our study provides new mechanistic insight into AD-associated autophagic stress, thus establishing a foundation for ameliorating axonal pathology in AD.</p>

            <p>Organ morphogenesis depends on the precise orchestration of cell migration, cell shape changes and cell adhesion. We demonstrate that Notch signaling is an integral part of the Wnt and Fgf signaling feedback loop coordinating cell migration and the self-organization of rosette-shaped sensory organs in the zebrafish lateral line system. We show that Notch signaling acts downstream of Fgf signaling to not only inhibit hair cell differentiation but also to induce and maintain stable epithelial rosettes. Ectopic Notch expression causes a significant increase in organ size independently of proliferation and the Hippo pathway. Transplantation and RNASeq analyses revealed that Notch signaling induces apical junctional complex genes that regulate cell adhesion and apical constriction. Our analysis also demonstrates that in the absence of patterning cues normally provided by a Wnt/Fgf signaling system, rosettes still self-organize in the presence of Notch signaling.</p>

            <p>Transient increases in mitochondrially-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate an adaptive stress response to promote longevity. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases produce ROS locally in response to various stimuli, and thereby regulate many cellular processes, but their role in aging remains unexplored. Here, we identified the <em>C. elegans</em> orthologue of mammalian mediator of ErbB2-driven cell motility, MEMO-1, as a protein that inhibits BLI-3/NADPH oxidase. MEMO-1 is complexed with RHO-1/RhoA/GTPase and loss of <em>memo-1</em> results in an enhanced interaction of RHO-1 with BLI-3/NADPH oxidase, thereby stimulating ROS production that signal via p38 MAP kinase to the transcription factor SKN-1/NRF1,2,3 to promote stress resistance and longevity. Either loss of <em>memo-1</em> or increasing BLI-3/NADPH oxidase activity by overexpression is sufficient to increase lifespan. Together, these findings demonstrate that NADPH oxidase-induced redox signaling initiates a transcriptional response that protects the cell and organism, and can promote both stress resistance and longevity.</p>

            Interacting with other individuals to negotiate how we want distribution of resources (e.g. money, time) to be made is an important part of our social life. Considering that not all of our requests from others are always granted, the outcomes of such social interactions are, by their nature, probabilistic and therefore, risky. While risk-perception has been well studied in non-social contexts, its computational mechanisms in social interactions remains unknown. Here, we investigated value computations underlying how people make unfair, fair or hyper-fair Ultimatum offers to others who accepted or rejected these offers probabilistically in relation to how they valued them. We showed that people adjust their risk-preferences dynamically in social interactions, and these can be predicted from a weighted linear combination of ones degree of prosociality (i.e. Social Value Orientation (SVO)), inference about the opponents SVO[boxh]including ones uncertainty in it; and relative prosociality ( SVO) interacting with ones risk attitude in the value-based domain. In tandem, our results provide the first evidence to suggest that dynamic risk taking is a cardinal element of social interactions.

            Changes in inhibitory connections are essential for experience-dependent circuit adaptations, and inhibitory defects may underlie neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism. Inhibitory axons and their presynaptic boutons can undergo rapid changes, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these dynamics and their role in inhibitory synapse formation are currently unclear. By monitoring inhibitory axons over time in organotypic hippocampal slices, we show that stabilization of presynaptic boutons is the first step in inhibitory synapse formation and that this process is regulated by the guidance protein Semaphorin4D (Sema4D). Sema4D signaling induces inhibitory bouton stabilization within tens of minutes without affecting bouton disassembly. We show that this signaling pathway requires ongoing neuronal activity, and involves activation of receptor tyrosine kinase MET and actin remodeling. Our data indicate that actin plays an important role during synapse formation and demonstrate a novel link between MET, a known autism risk factor, and inhibitory presynaptic dynamics.

            Subjective experience suggests that we are able to direct our auditory attention independent of our visual gaze, e.g when shadowing a nearby conversation at a cocktail party. But what are the consequences at the behavioural and neural level? While numerous studies have investigated both auditory attention and visual gaze independently, little is known about their interaction during selective listening. In the present EEG study, we manipulated visual gaze independently of auditory attention while participants detected targets presented from one of three loudspeakers. We observed increased response times when gaze was directed away from the locus of auditory attention. Further, we found an increase in occipital alpha-band power contralateral to the direction of gaze, indicative of a suppression of distracting input. Finally, this condition also led to stronger central theta-band power, which correlated with the observed effect in response times, indicative of differences in top-down processing. Our data suggest that a misalignment between gaze and auditory attention both reduce behavioural performance and modulate underlying neural processes. The involvement of central theta-band and occipital alpha-band effects are in line with compensatory neural mechanisms such as increased cognitive control and the suppression of task irrelevant inputs.

            <p>by Eric Jonas, Konrad Paul Kording</p>

There is a popular belief in neuroscience that we are primarily data limited, and that producing large, multimodal, and complex datasets will, with the help of advanced data analysis algorithms, lead to fundamental insights into the way the brain processes information. These datasets do not yet exist, and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems, regardless of the amount of data. Additionally, we argue for scientists using complex non-linear dynamical systems with known ground truth, such as the microprocessor as a validation platform for time-series and structure discovery methods.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1JEMdUjXaWM" width="1" />

            <p>by Luc E. Coffeng, Cornelus C. Hermsen, Robert W. Sauerwein, Sake J. de Vlas</p>

Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) in healthy human volunteers is an important and powerful tool in clinical malaria vaccine development. However, power calculations are essential to obtain meaningful estimates of protective efficacy, while minimizing the risk of adverse events. To optimize power calculations for CHMI-based malaria vaccine trials, we developed a novel non-linear statistical model for parasite kinetics as measured by qPCR, using data from mosquito-based CHMI experiments in 57 individuals. We robustly account for important sources of variation between and within individuals using a Bayesian framework. Study power is most dependent on the number of individuals in each treatment arm; inter-individual variation in vaccine efficacy and the number of blood samples taken per day matter relatively little. Due to high inter-individual variation in the number of first-generation parasites, hepatic vaccine trials required significantly more study subjects than erythrocytic vaccine trials. We provide power calculations for hypothetical malaria vaccine trials of various designs and conclude that so far, power calculations have been overly optimistic. We further illustrate how upcoming techniques like needle-injected CHMI may reduce required sample sizes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1eBvvvKwTmo" width="1" />

            <p>by Abby Tabor, Michael A. Thacker, G. Lorimer Moseley, Konrad P. Körding</p>

Perception is seen as a process that utilises partial and noisy information to construct a coherent understanding of the world. Here we argue that the experience of pain is no different; it is based on incomplete, multimodal information, which is used to estimate potential bodily threat. We outline a Bayesian inference model, incorporating the key components of cue combination, causal inference, and temporal integration, which highlights the statistical problems in everyday perception. It is from this platform that we are able to review the pain literature, providing evidence from experimental, acute, and persistent phenomena to demonstrate the advantages of adopting a statistical account in pain. Our probabilistic conceptualisation suggests a principles-based view of pain, explaining a broad range of experimental and clinical findings and making testable predictions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Bh7yxKC5ZHM" width="1" />

            <p>Symbiotic bacteria assist in maintaining homeostasis of the animal immune system. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie symbiont-mediated host immunity are largely unknown. Tsetse flies (<em>Glossina</em> spp.) house maternally transmitted symbionts that regulate the development and function of their host’s immune system. Herein we demonstrate that the obligate mutualist, <em>Wigglesworthia</em>, up-regulates expression of <em>odorant binding protein six</em> in the gut of intrauterine tsetse larvae. This process is necessary and sufficient to induce systemic expression of the hematopoietic RUNX transcription factor <em>lozenge</em> and the subsequent production of crystal cells, which actuate the melanotic immune response in adult tsetse. Larval <em>Drosophila’s</em> indigenous microbiota, which is acquired from the environment, regulates an orthologous hematopoietic pathway in their host. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie enteric symbiont-stimulated systemic immune system development, and indicate that these processes are evolutionarily conserved despite the divergent nature of host-symbiont interactions in these model systems.</p>

            <p>Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a pediatric malignacy of muscle with myogenic regulatory transcription factors MYOD and MYF5 being expressed in this disease. Consensus in the field has been that expression of these factors likely reflects the target cell of transformation rather than being required for continued tumor growth. Here, we used a transgenic zebrafish model to show that Myf5 is sufficient to confer tumor-propagating potential to RMS cells and caused tumors to initiate earlier and have higher penetrance. Analysis of human RMS revealed that MYF5 and MYOD are mutually-exclusively expressed and each is required for sustained tumor growth. ChIP-seq and mechanistic studies in human RMS uncovered that MYF5 and MYOD bind common DNA regulatory elements to alter transcription of genes that regulate muscle development and cell cycle progression. Our data support unappreciated and dominant oncogenic roles for MYF5 and MYOD convergence on common transcriptional targets to regulate human RMS growth.</p>

            Interhemispheric functional connectivity abnormalities are often reported in autism and it is thus not surprising that structural defects of the corpus callosum (CC) are consistently found using both traditional MRI and DTI techniques. Past DTI studies however, have subdivided the CC into 2 or 3 segments without regard for where fibers may project to within the cortex, thus placing limitations on our ability to understand the nature, timing and neurobehavioral impact of early CC abnormalities in autism. Leveraging a unique cohort of 97 toddlers (68 autism; 29 typical) we utilized a novel technique that identified seven CC tracts according to their cortical projections. Results revealed that younger (&lt;2.5 years old), but not older toddlers with autism exhibited abnormally low mean, radial, and axial diffusivity values in the CC tracts connecting the occipital lobes and the temporal lobes. Fractional anisotropy and the cross sectional area of the temporal CC tract were significantly larger in young toddlers with autism. These findings indicate that water diffusion is more restricted and unidirectional in the temporal CC tract of young toddlers who develop autism. Such results may be explained by a potential overabundance of small caliber axons generated by excessive prenatal neural proliferation as proposed by previous genetic, animal model, and postmortem studies of autism. Furthermore, early diffusion measures in the temporal CC tract of the young toddlers were correlated with outcome measures of autism severity at later ages. These findings regarding the potential nature, timing, and location of early CC abnormalities in autism add to accumulating evidence, which suggests that altered inter-hemispheric connectivity, particularly across the temporal lobes, is a hallmark of the disorder.

            Background: Standard BOLD connectivity analyses depend on aggregating the signals of individual voxels within regions of interest (ROIs). In certain cases, this spatial aggregation implies a loss of valuable functional and anatomical information about subsets of voxels that drive the ROI level connectivity. New Method: We use the FGES algorithm, a data-driven score-based graphical search method, to identify subsets of voxels that are chiefly responsible for exchanging signals between ROIs. We apply the method to high-resolution resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from medial temporal lobe regions of interest of a single healthy individual measured repeated times over a year and a half. Results: The FGES algorithm recovered subsets of voxels within larger medial temporal lobe ROIs of entorhinal cortex and hippocampus subfields that show spatially consistency across different scanning sessions, and are statistically significant under tests that validate the role of these subsets as main drivers of effective connectivity between hippocampal regions of interest. Comparison with Existing Methods: In contrast to standard functional connectivity methods, the FGES algorithm is robust against false positive connections produced by transitive closures of adjacencies (correlation methods) and common effect conditioning (Markov random field methods). Conclusions: The FGES algorithm allows for identification of communication subsets of voxels driving the connectivity between regions of interest, recovering valuable anatomical and functional information that is lost when ROIs are aggregated. The FGES algorithm is specially suited for voxelwise connectivity research, given its short running time and scalability to big data problems.

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: While vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAM) can be diagnosed in the fetus, the challenge is predicting the occurrence of its two major complications: cardiopulmonary failure and encephalomalacia. This study attempts to determine which fetal brain MRI features might be used to predict the development of these complications at birth.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: The cohort was extracted from a prospectively-assembled database of VGAM cases managed at a single referral centre from 2000 to 2014. Of 251 patients with VGAM, 83 cases were diagnosed prenatally. A total of 58 patient charts having at least one fetal MRI were reviewed. Patterns of brain parenchyma, hydrocephalus and so-called middle cerebral artery (MCA) “pseudo-feeders” were correlated with cardiac failure, pulmonary hypertension and encephalomalacia at birth.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: The median gestational age at fetal MRI was 32.3 WP (±2.3). Nine fetuses (16%) had encephalomalacia. Thirty-one fetuses (53%) had MCA pseudo-feeders. Twenty-six fetuses (45%) had prenatal hydrocephalus. Prenatal MCA pseudo-feeders were a risk factor for encephalomalacia at birth (p=0.001). MCA pseudo-feeders and hydrocephalus were risk factors for both severe cardiac failure (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively) and severe pulmonary hypertension (p=0.014 and p=0.05, respectively) at birth.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: MCA pseudo-feeders are the result of impaired cerebral blood flow, and are thus a risk factor for further brain-melting at birth. Their presence can be used for informing parents and as an aid in management decisions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

            <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Sensitive, objective and easily applied methods for evaluating disease progression and response to therapy are needed for clinical trials in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In this study, we evaluated whether electrical impedance myography (EIM) could serve this purpose.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: In this non-blinded study, 36 boys with DMD and 29 age-similar healthy boys underwent multifrequency EIM measurements for up to 2 years on 6 muscles unilaterally along with functional assessments. A linear mixed-effects model with random intercept and slope terms was used for the analysis of multifrequency EIM values and functional measures. Seven DMD boys were initiated on corticosteroids; these data were analyzed using a piecewise linear mixed-effects model.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: In boys &gt;7.0 years, a significant difference in the slope of EIM phase-ratio trajectories in the upper extremity was observed by 6 months of -0.074/month, p=0.023, 95% confidence interval (CI)[-0.013,-0.14]); at two years, this difference was -0.048/month, p&lt;0.0001 95%CI[-0.028,-0.068]. In boys ≤7.0 years, differences appeared at 6 months in gastrocnemius (EIM phase-slope -0.83<b>°</b>/kHz-month, p=0.007 95%CI[-0.26,-1.40]). EIM outcomes showed significant differences earlier than functional tests. Initiation of corticosteroids significantly improved the slope of EIM phase-ratio (0.057/month, p=0.00019 95%CI[0.028,0.086]) and EIM phase-slope (0.14<b>°</b>/kHz-month, p=0.013 95%CI[0.028,0.25]), consistent with corticosteroids' known clinical benefit.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: EIM detects deterioration in muscles of both younger and older boys by 6 months; it also identifies the therapeutic effect of corticosteroid initiation. Since EIM is rapid to apply, painless, and requires minimal operator training, the technique deserves to be further evaluated as a biomarker in DMD clinical therapeutic trials.

            <p>by Fabrizio De Vico Fallani, Vito Latora, Mario Chavez</p>

In many biological systems, the network of interactions between the elements can only be inferred from experimental measurements. In neuroscience, non-invasive imaging tools are extensively used to derive either structural or functional brain networks <i>in-vivo</i>. As a result of the inference process, we obtain a matrix of values corresponding to a fully connected and weighted network. To turn this into a useful sparse network, thresholding is typically adopted to cancel a percentage of the weakest connections. The structural properties of the resulting network depend on how much of the inferred connectivity is eventually retained. However, how to objectively fix this threshold is still an open issue. We introduce a criterion, the efficiency cost optimization (ECO), to select a threshold based on the optimization of the trade-off between the efficiency of a network and its wiring cost. We prove analytically and we confirm through numerical simulations that the connection density maximizing this trade-off emphasizes the intrinsic properties of a given network, while preserving its sparsity. Moreover, this density threshold can be determined <i>a-priori</i>, since the number of connections to filter only depends on the network size according to a power-law. We validate this result on several brain networks, from micro- to macro-scales, obtained with different imaging modalities. Finally, we test the potential of ECO in discriminating brain states with respect to alternative filtering methods. ECO advances our ability to analyze and compare biological networks, inferred from experimental data, in a fast and principled way.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/htJqKxnllQ8" width="1" />

            <p>by James M. Kunert, Joshua L. Proctor, Steven L. Brunton, J. Nathan Kutz</p>

Using a computational model of the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> connectome dynamics, we show that proprioceptive feedback is necessary for sustained dynamic responses to external input. This is consistent with the lack of biophysical evidence for a central pattern generator, and recent experimental evidence that proprioception drives locomotion. The low-dimensional functional response of the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> network of neurons to proprioception-like feedback is optimized by input of specific spatial wavelengths which correspond to the spatial scale of real body shape dynamics. Furthermore, we find that the motor subcircuit of the network is responsible for regulating this response, in agreement with experimental expectations. To explore how the connectomic dynamics produces the observed two-mode, oscillatory limit cycle behavior from a static fixed point, we probe the fixed point’s low-dimensional structure using Dynamic Mode Decomposition. This reveals that the nonlinear network dynamics encode six clusters of dynamic modes, with timescales spanning three orders of magnitude. Two of these six dynamic mode clusters correspond to previously-discovered behavioral modes related to locomotion. These dynamic modes and their timescales are encoded by the network’s degree distribution and specific connectivity. This suggests that behavioral dynamics are partially encoded within the connectome itself, the connectivity of which facilitates proprioceptive control.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dtiuAq-83vk" width="1" />

            <p>by Andrea Insabato, Mario Pannunzi, Gustavo Deco</p>

The uncertain option task has been recently adopted to investigate the neural systems underlying the decision confidence. Latterly single neurons activity has been recorded in lateral intraparietal cortex of monkeys performing an uncertain option task, where the subject is allowed to opt for a small but sure reward instead of making a risky perceptual decision. We propose a multiple choice model implemented in a discrete attractors network. This model is able to reproduce both behavioral and neurophysiological experimental data and therefore provides support to the numerous perspectives that interpret the uncertain option task as a sensory-motor association. The model explains the behavioral and neural data recorded in monkeys as the result of the multistable attractor landscape and produces several testable predictions. One of these predictions may help distinguish our model from a recently proposed continuous attractor model.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H1fabxnUVis" width="1" />

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: To report the identification of microtubule associated protein (MAP)1B as the antigen of the previously described PCA-2 antibody, its frequency and clinical, oncological and serological associations.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b> Archival serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were available from 96 of 118 consecutive PCA-2-IgG-seropositive patients identified 1993-2016. The autoantigen, defined in mouse brain lysate by western blot and mass spectrometry, was confirmed by dual immunohistochemical staining using commercial antibodies. The major antigenic region was defined by western blot using recombinant protein fragments.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b> IgG in 95 of 96 patients' serum or CSF (but in none of 98 healthy or disease control subjects' serum specimens) bound to recombinant microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 1B. A minority (17.5%) of patients' IgG also bound to MAP1A. PCA-2 was often accompanied by additional neural autoantibody markers of small-cell carcinoma, including CRMP-5-IgG (26%) or ANNA-1-IgG (anti-Hu; 13%). Neurological manifestations in 95 patients were (in decreasing frequency): peripheral neuropathy, 53%, cerebellar ataxia, dysmetria or dysarthria, 38%, encephalopathy, 27%. Cancer (majority SCLC) was detected in 66 of 84 evaluated patients (79%). The MAP1B (PCA-2) autoantibody detection rate, among approximately 70,000 patients undergoing service neural autoantibody evaluation in 2015 was 0.024%, equaling amphiphysin-IgG (0.026%) and more common than ANNA-2 (anti-Ri; 0.016%) and PCA-Tr (DNER; 0.006%).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b> MAP1B, the PCA-2 autoantigen, represents a novel target in paraneoplastic neurological disorders and has high predictive value for SCLC. Its relatively high prevalence, compared with other recognized paraneoplastic neural autoantibodies, justifies its testing in comprehensive paraneoplastic neural autoantibody evaluation.

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>We assessed quality of life (QoL) and psychological wellbeing in patients with ALS-induced locked-in-state and their next of kin in a fully unbiased manner using eye-tracking computer systems (ETCS). Eleven of 30 screened patients and nine next of kin completed study procedures. Patients reported good QoL which appeared to be at the cost of the QoL of their next of kin. Next of kin rated their own or patients' QoL similarly, but they identified different areas as important as compared with patients. Our results are of importance for the discussion of end-of-life-decisions and the evaluation of the patient's presumed wishes as well as for psychosocial interventions.

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective: Rewiring of excitatory glutamatergic neuronal circuits is a major abnormality in epilepsy. Besides the rewiring of excitatory circuit, an abnormal depolarizing GABAergic drive has been hypothesized to participate in the epileptogenic processes. However, a remaining clinically relevant question is whether early post Status Epilepticus (SE) evoked chloride dysregulation is important for the remodeling of aberrant glutamatergic neuronal circuit.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods: Osmotic mini-pumps were used to infuse intracerebrally a specific inhibitor of depolarizing GABAergic transmission as well as a functionally blocking antibody towards the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75<sup>NTR</sup>). The compounds were infused between 2 and 5 days after pilocarpine-induced SE. Immunohistochemistry for NKCC1, KCC2 and ectopic recurrent mossy fiber (rMF) sprouting as well as telemetric EEG and electrophysiological recordings were performed at day 5 and 2 months post-SE.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results: Blockade of NKCC1 after SE with the specific inhibitor bumetanide restored NKCC1 and KCC2 expression, normalized chloride homeostasis and significantly reduced the glutamatergic recurrent mossy fiber sprouting (rMF) within the dentate gyrus. This mechanism partially involves p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling as bumetanide application reduced SE-induced p75<sup>NTR</sup> expression and functional blockade of p75<sup>NTR</sup> decreased rMF sprouting. The early transient (3days) post-SE infusion of bumetanide reduced rMF sprouting and recurrent seizures in the chronic epileptic phase.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation: Our findings show that early post-SE abnormal depolarizing GABA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> signalings foster a long lasting rearrangement of glutamatergic network that contributes to the epileptogenic process. This finding defines promising and novel targets to constrain reactive glutamatergic network rewiring in adult epilepsy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

            <p>Sensory signals undergo substantial recoding when neural activity is relayed from sensors through pre-thalamic and thalamic nuclei to cortex. To explore how temporal dynamics and directional tuning are sculpted in hierarchical vestibular circuits, we compared responses of macaque otolith afferents with neurons in the vestibular and cerebellar nuclei, as well as five cortical areas, to identical three-dimensional translational motion. We demonstrate a remarkable spatio-temporal transformation: otolith afferents carry spatially aligned cosine-tuned translational acceleration and jerk signals. In contrast, brainstem and cerebellar neurons exhibit non-linear, mixed selectivity for translational velocity, acceleration, jerk and position. Furthermore, these components often show dissimilar spatial tuning. Moderate further transformation of translation signals occurs in the cortex, such that similar spatio-temporal properties are found in multiple cortical areas. These results suggest that the first synapse represents a key processing element in vestibular pathways, robustly shaping how self-motion is represented in central vestibular circuits and cortical areas.</p>

            <p>Hebb's idea of a cell assembly as the fundamental unit of neural information processing has dominated neuroscience like no other theoretical concept within the past 60 years. A range of different physiological phenomena, from precisely synchronized spiking to broadly simultaneous rate increases, has been subsumed under this term. Yet progress in this area is hampered by the lack of statistical tools that would enable to extract assemblies with arbitrary constellations of time lags, and at multiple temporal scales, partly due to the severe computational burden. Here we present such a unifying methodological and conceptual framework which detects assembly structure at many different time scales, levels of precision, and with arbitrary internal organization. Applying this methodology to multiple single unit recordings from various cortical areas, we find that there is no universal cortical coding scheme, but that assembly structure and precision significantly depends on the brain area recorded and ongoing task demands.</p>

            Changes in behavioral state are associated with modulation of sensory responses across visual, auditory and somatosensory cortices. Here we show that locomotor activity independently modulates performance in delay eyeblink conditioning, a cerebellum-dependent form of associative learning. Increased locomotor speed in head-fixed mice was associated with earlier onset of learning and trial-by-trial enhancement of learned responses. The influence of locomotion on conditioned responses was dissociable from changes in arousal and was independent of the sensory modality of the conditioned stimulus. Eyelid responses evoked by optogenetic stimulation of mossy fiber terminals within the cerebellar cortex, but not at sites downstream, were also positively modulated by ongoing locomotion. We conclude that locomotor activity modulates delay eyeblink conditioning through mechanisms acting on the mossy fiber pathway within the cerebellar cortex. Taken together, these results suggest a novel role for behavioral state modulation in associative learning and provide a potential mechanism through which engaging in movement can improve an individual's ability to learn.

            Background. Corticosteroids-stress hormones released from the adrenal cortex-reduce phobic fear in humans and enhance psychotherapy, possibly by reducing the retrieval of fear memory. However, the underlying neural mechanism is not yet fully understood. Methods. We investigated the neural correlates of the acute fear-reducing effect of glucocorticoid administration in phobia with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. We analysed fMRI data of participants diagnosed with spider phobia (n = 28) and healthy controls (n = 18) using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA). The spider-phobic patients received oral glucocorticoids (20 mg of hydrocortisone) or placebos. Participants rated their subjective fear while viewing spider or non-phobic pictures in the scanner. Results. Patients in the placebo and cortisol group exhibited increased decoding of phobic images in the middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and bilateral anterior insula compared to healthy controls with decoding at chance level. Patients with cortisol had less decoding in the MCC. Decoding of spider pictures in the MCC explained 38% of subjective fear across all individuals. In the placebo group, a causal model explained 12% variance in subjective fear influenced by the right anterior insula and the MCC; this relationship was changed in the cortisol group. Conclusions. These results suggest that the anterior insula and the MCC are strongly related to the decoding of phobic stimuli. Glucocorticoids seem to modulate the circuitry of MCC and anterior insula leading to a reduction in subjective fear.

            <p>by Emanuel Gonçalves, Zrinka Raguz Nakic, Mattia Zampieri, Omar Wagih, David Ochoa, Uwe Sauer, Pedro Beltrao, Julio Saez-Rodriguez</p>

Cells react to extracellular perturbations with complex and intertwined responses. Systematic identification of the regulatory mechanisms that control these responses is still a challenge and requires tailored analyses integrating different types of molecular data. Here we acquired time-resolved metabolomics measurements in yeast under salt and pheromone stimulation and developed a machine learning approach to explore regulatory associations between metabolism and signal transduction. Existing phosphoproteomics measurements under the same conditions and kinase-substrate regulatory interactions were used to <i>in silico</i> estimate the enzymatic activity of signalling kinases. Our approach identified informative associations between kinases and metabolic enzymes capable of predicting metabolic changes. We extended our analysis to two studies containing transcriptomics, phosphoproteomics and metabolomics measurements across a comprehensive panel of kinases/phosphatases knockouts and time-resolved perturbations to the nitrogen metabolism. Changes in activity of transcription factors, kinases and phosphatases were estimated <i>in silico</i> and these were capable of building predictive models to infer the metabolic adaptations of previously unseen conditions across different dynamic experiments. Time-resolved experiments were significantly more informative than genetic perturbations to infer metabolic adaptation. This difference may be due to the indirect nature of the associations and of general cellular states that can hinder the identification of causal relationships. This work provides a novel genome-scale integrative analysis to propose putative transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms of metabolic processes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rwLh2BLXkwQ" width="1" />

            <p>Pregnancy complications are poorly represented in the archeological record, despite their importance in contemporary and ancient societies. While excavating a Byzantine cemetery in Troy, we discovered calcified abscesses among a woman’s remains. Scanning electron microscopy of the tissue revealed ‘ghost cells’, resulting from dystrophic calcification, which preserved ancient maternal, fetal and bacterial DNA of a severe infection, likely chorioamnionitis. <em>Gardnerella vaginalis</em> and <em>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</em> dominated the abscesses. Phylogenomic analyses of ancient, historical, and contemporary data showed that <em>G. vaginalis</em> Troy fell within contemporary genetic diversity, whereas <em>S. saprophyticus</em> Troy belongs to a lineage that does not appear to be commonly associated with human disease today. We speculate that the ecology of <em>S. saprophyticus</em> infection may have differed in the ancient world as a result of close contacts between humans and domesticated animals. These results highlight the complex and dynamic interactions with our microbial milieu that underlie severe maternal infections.</p>

            <p>Many pancreatic transcription factors that are essential for islet cell differentiation have been well characterized; however, because they are often expressed in several different cell populations, their functional hierarchy remains unclear. To parse out the spatiotemporal regulation of islet cell differentiation, we used a <em>Neurog3-Cre</em> allele to ablate <em>Nkx2.2</em>, one of the earliest and most broadly expressed islet transcription factors, specifically in the Neurog3<sup>+</sup> endocrine progenitor lineage (<em>Nkx2.2<sup>△endo</sup></em>). Remarkably, many essential components of the β cell transcriptional network that were down-regulated in the <em>Nkx2.2<sup>KO</sup></em> mice, were maintained in the <em>Nkx2.2<sup>△endo</sup></em> mice - yet the <em>Nkx2.2<sup>△endo</sup></em> mice displayed defective β cell differentiation and recapitulated the <em>Nkx2.2<sup>KO</sup></em> phenotype. This suggests that Nkx2.2 is not only required in the early pancreatic progenitors, but has additional essential activities within the endocrine progenitor population. Consistently, we demonstrate Nkx2.2 functions as an integral component of a modular regulatory program to correctly specify pancreatic islet cell fates.</p>

            Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of transmitter release probability (Pr) are thought to be triggered by the activation of glutamate receptors. Here, we demonstrate that glutamate release at CA3-CA1 synapses is in fact inhibitory and unnecessary for increases in Pr. Instead, at active presynaptic terminals, postsynaptic depolarization alone can increase Pr by promoting the release of nitric oxide from neuronal dendrites in a manner dependent on L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The release of glutamate, in contrast, decreases Pr by activating presynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDAR). Thus, net changes in Pr are determined by the combined effect of both LTP-promoting and LTD-promoting processes, that is, by the amount of glutamate release and postsynaptic depolarization that accompany presynaptic activity, respectively. Neither of these processes directly depends on the activation of postsynaptic NMDARs. We further show that presynaptic changes can be captured by a simple mathematical framework, in which the role of presynaptic plasticity is to ensure that the ability for a presynaptic terminal to release glutamate is matched with its ability to predict postsynaptic spiking.

            Across the domains of spatial navigation and episodic memory, the hippocampus is thought to play a critical role in forming distinct representations of overlapping events. However, it is less clear how and when hippocampal representations of overlapping events become distinct. Here, using spatiotemporal pattern analysis of human fMRI data, we measured learning-related changes in hippocampal representations of overlapping real-world routes. We found that learning resulted in highly targeted representational changes within the hippocampus that specifically reduced similarity among overlapping routes. Strikingly, and in contrast to representations in other navigation-related brain regions, hippocampal representations of overlapping routes diverged to the point where overlapping routes became less similar than non-overlapping routes. This learning-related plasticity preferentially occurred for hippocampal voxels that were initially shared across overlapping routes. Collectively, these findings indicate that overlap among event representations triggers a divergence of hippocampal activity patterns that dramatically reshapes representational structure.

            <p>by Nada Yousif, Michael Mace, Nicola Pavese, Roman Borisyuk, Dipankar Nandi, Peter Bain</p>

Essential tremor (ET), a movement disorder characterised by an uncontrollable shaking of the affected body part, is often professed to be the most common movement disorder, affecting up to one percent of adults over 40 years of age. The precise cause of ET is unknown, however pathological oscillations of a network of a number of brain regions are implicated in leading to the disorder. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a clinical therapy used to alleviate the symptoms of a number of movement disorders. DBS involves the surgical implantation of electrodes into specific nuclei in the brain. For ET the targeted region is the ventralis intermedius (Vim) nucleus of the thalamus. Though DBS is effective for treating ET, the mechanism through which the therapeutic effect is obtained is not understood. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the pathological network activity and the effect of DBS on such activity, we take a computational modelling approach combined with electrophysiological data. The pathological brain activity was recorded intra-operatively via implanted DBS electrodes, whilst simultaneously recording muscle activity of the affected limbs. We modelled the network hypothesised to underlie ET using the Wilson-Cowan approach. The modelled network exhibited oscillatory behaviour within the tremor frequency range, as did our electrophysiological data. By applying a DBS-like input we suppressed these oscillations. This study shows that the dynamics of the ET network support oscillations at the tremor frequency and the application of a DBS-like input disrupts this activity, which could be one mechanism underlying the therapeutic benefit.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zdfydetO3Tw" width="1" />

            <p>Animals host multi-species microbial communities (microbiomes) whose properties may result from inter-species interactions; however, current understanding of host-microbiome interactions derives mostly from studies in which elucidation of microbe-microbe interactions is difficult. In exploring how <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> acquires its microbiome, we found that a microbial community influences <em>Drosophila</em> olfactory and egg-laying behaviors differently than individual members. <em>Drosophila</em> prefers a <em>Saccharomyces</em>-<em>Acetobacter</em> co-culture to the same microorganisms grown individually and then mixed, a response mainly due to the conserved olfactory receptor, <em>Or42b. Acetobacter</em> metabolism of <em>Saccharomyces-</em>derived ethanol was necessary, and acetate and its metabolic derivatives were sufficient, for co-culture preference. Preference correlated with three emergent co-culture properties: ethanol catabolism, a distinct volatile profile, and yeast population decline. Egg-laying preference provided a context-dependent fitness benefit to larvae. We describe a molecular mechanism by which a microbial community affects animal behavior. Our results support a model whereby emergent metabolites signal a beneficial multispecies microbiome.</p>

            <p>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is believed to confer protection against <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> malaria, but the precise nature of the protective effect has proved difficult to define as G6PD deficiency has multiple allelic variants with different effects in males and females, and it has heterogeneous effects on the clinical outcome of <em>P. falciparum</em> infection. Here we report an analysis of multiple allelic forms of G6PD deficiency in a large multi-centre case-control study of severe malaria, using the WHO classification of G6PD mutations to estimate each individual’s level of enzyme activity from their genotype. Aggregated across all genotypes, we find that increasing levels of G6PD deficiency are associated with decreasing risk of cerebral malaria, but with increased risk of severe malarial anaemia. Models of balancing selection based on these findings indicate that an evolutionary trade-off between different clinical outcomes of <em>P. falciparum</em> infection could have been a major cause of the high levels of G6PD polymorphism seen in human populations.</p>

            Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) was recently revealed to be a synaptic player during plasticity events in addition to its well-established role as a general controlling factor in cell proliferation and neuronal growth during development. Alterations of these direct actions of PTEN at synapses may lead to synaptic dysfunction with behavioral and cognitive consequences. A recent paradigmatic example of this situation, Alzheimer's disease (AD), is associated with excessive recruitment of PTEN into synapses leading to pathological synaptic depression.

            <p>Cell biology differs between traditional cell culture and 3-dimensional (3-D) systems, and is modulated by the extracellular matrix. Experimentation in 3-D presents challenges, especially with virulent pathogens. <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (Mtb) kills more humans than any other infection and is characterised by a spatially organised immune response and extracellular matrix remodelling. We developed a 3-D system incorporating virulent mycobacteria, primary human blood mononuclear cells and collagen–alginate matrix to dissect the host-pathogen interaction. Infection in 3-D led to greater cellular survival and permitted longitudinal analysis over 21 days. Key features of human tuberculosis develop, and extracellular matrix integrity favours the host over the pathogen. We optimised multiparameter readouts to study emerging therapeutic interventions: cytokine supplementation, host-directed therapy and immunoaugmentation. Each intervention modulates the host-pathogen interaction, but has both beneficial and harmful effects. This methodology has wide applicability to investigate infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases and develop novel drug regimes and vaccination approaches.</p>

We report a dichotomy between graft structure and clinical function in a patient dying 16 years following fetal nigral grafting.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24820-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>A 55-year-old levodopa-responsive woman with PD received bilateral putaminal fetal mesencephalic grafts as part of an NIH-sponsored double-blind sham-controlled trial. The patient never experienced clinical benefit, and her course was complicated by the development of graft-related dyskinesias. Fluorodopa positron emission tomography demonstrated significant increases postgrafting bilaterally. She experienced worsening of parkinsonism with severe dyskinesias, and underwent subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation 8 years after grafting. She died 16 years after transplantation.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24820-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Postmortem analyses confirmed the diagnosis of PD and demonstrated &gt;300,000 tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive grafted cells per side with normalized striatal TH-immunoreactive fiber innervation and bidirectional synaptic connectivity. Twenty-seven percent and 17% of grafted neurons were serine 129-phosphorylated α-synuclein positive in the left and right putamen, respectively.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24820-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>These findings represent the largest number of surviving dopamine neurons and the densest and most widespread graft-mediated striatal dopamine reinnervation following a transplant procedure reported to date. Despite this, clinical recovery was not observed. Furthermore, the grafts were associated with a form of dyskinesias that resembled diphasic dyskinesia and persisted in the off-medication state. We hypothesize that the grafted cells produced a low level of dopamine sufficient to cause a levodopa-independent continuous form of diphasic dyskinesias, but insufficient to provide an antiparkinsonian benefit.

            <p>Efficient control of principal neuron firing by basket cells is critical for information processing in cortical microcircuits, however, the relative contribution of their perisomatic and dendritic synapses to spike inhibition is still unknown. Using in vitro electrophysiological paired recordings we reveal that in the mouse basal amygdala cholecystokinin- and parvalbumin-containing basket cells provide equally potent control of principal neuron spiking. We performed pharmacological manipulations, light and electron microscopic investigations to show that, although basket cells innervate the entire somato-denditic membrane surface of principal neurons, the spike controlling effect is achieved primarily via the minority of synapses targeting the perisomatic region. As the innervation patterns of individual basket cells on their different postsynaptic partners show high variability, the impact of inhibitory control accomplished by single basket cells is also variable. Our results show that both basket cell types can powerfully regulate the activity in amygdala networks predominantly via their perisomatic synapses.</p>

            <p>mRNA is cotranscrptionally processed and packaged into messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) in the nucleus. Prior to export through the nuclear pore, mRNPs undergo several obligatory remodeling reactions. In yeast, one of these reactions involves loading of the mRNA-binding protein Yra1 by the DEAD-box ATPase Sub2 as assisted by the hetero-pentameric THO complex. To obtain molecular insights into reaction mechanisms, we determined crystal structures of two relevant complexes: a THO hetero-pentamer bound to Sub2 at 6.0 Å resolution; and Sub2 associated with an ATP analogue, RNA, and a C-terminal fragment of Yra1 (Yra1-C) at 2.6 Å resolution. We found that the 25 nm long THO clamps Sub2 in a half-open configuration; in contrast, when bound to the ATP analogue, RNA and Yra1-C, Sub2 assumes a closed conformation. Both THO and Yra1-C stimulated Sub2’s intrinsic ATPase activity. We propose that THO surveys common landmarks in each nuclear mRNP to localize Sub2 for targeted loading of Yra1.</p>

            <p>Visual perception and behavior are mediated by cortical areas that have been distinguished using architectonic and retinotopic criteria. We employed fluorescence imaging and GCaMP6 reporter mice to generate retinotopic maps, revealing additional regions of retinotopic organization that extend into barrel and retrosplenial cortices. Aligning retinotopic maps to architectonic borders, we found a mismatch in border location, indicating that architectonic borders are not aligned with the retinotopic transition at the vertical meridian. We also assessed the representation of visual space within each region, finding that four visual areas bordering V1 (LM, P, PM and RL) display complementary representations, with overlap primarily at the central hemifield. Our results extend our understanding of the organization of mouse cortex to include up to 16 distinct retinotopically organized regions.</p>

            <p>Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) mediates updating and maintenance of cognitive models of the world used to drive adaptive reward-guided behavior. We investigated the neurochemical underpinnings of this process. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy in humans, to measure levels of glutamate and GABA in dACC. We examined their relationship to neural signals in dACC, measured with fMRI, and cognitive task performance. Both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters in dACC were predictive of the strength of neural signals in dACC and behavioral adaptation. Glutamate levels were correlated, first, with stronger neural activity representing information to be learnt about the tasks’ costs and benefits and, second, greater use of this information in the guidance of behavior. GABA levels were negatively correlated with the same neural signals and the same indices of behavioral influence. Our results suggest that glutamate and GABA in dACC affect the encoding and use of past experiences to guide behavior.</p>

            <p>Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is enriched at the synapse, but its synaptic function is still poorly understood. We previously showed that GABAergic short-term plasticity is impaired in <em>App</em> knock-out (<em>App<sup>-/-</sup></em>) animals, but the precise mechanism by which APP regulates GABAergic synaptic transmission has remained elusive. Using electrophysiological, biochemical, moleculobiological, and pharmacological analysis, here we show that APP can physically interact with KCC2, a neuron-specific K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter that is essential for Cl<sup>-</sup> homeostasis and fast GABAergic inhibition. APP deficiency results in significant reductions in both total and membrane KCC2 levels, leading to a depolarizing shift in the GABA reversal potential (E<sub>GABA</sub>). Simultaneous measurement of presynaptic action potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in hippocampal neurons reveals impaired unitary IPSC amplitudes attributable to a reduction in α1 subunit levels of GABA<sub>A</sub>R. Importantly, restoration of normal KCC2 expression and function in <em>App<sup>-/-</sup></em> mice rescues E<sub>GABA</sub>, GABA<sub>A</sub>R α1 levels and GABA<sub>A</sub>R mediated phasic inhibition. We show that APP functions to limit tyrosine-phosphorylation and ubiquitination and thus subsequent degradation of KCC2, providing a mechanism by which APP influences KCC2 abundance. Together, these experiments elucidate a novel molecular pathway in which APP regulates, via protein-protein interaction with KCC2, GABA<sub>A</sub>R mediated inhibition in the hippocampus.</p>

            <p>Reconstructing the lineage of cells is central to understanding how the wide diversity of cell types develops. Here, we provide the neurosensory lineage reconstruction of a complex sensory organ, the inner ear, by imaging zebrafish embryos in vivo over an extended timespan, combining cell tracing and cell fate marker expression over time. We deliver the first dynamic map of early neuronal and sensory progenitor pools in the whole otic vesicle. It highlights the remodeling of the neuronal progenitor domain upon neuroblast delamination, and reveals that the order and place of neuroblasts’ delamination from the otic epithelium prefigure their position within the SAG. Sensory and non-sensory domains harbor different proliferative activity contributing distinctly to the overall growth of the structure. Therefore, the otic vesicle case exemplifies a generic morphogenetic process where spatial and temporal cues regulate cell fate and functional organization of the rudiment of the definitive organ.</p>

            <p>Gene conversions resulting from meiotic recombination are critical in shaping genome diversification and evolution. How the extent of gene conversions is regulated is unknown. Here we show that the budding yeast mismatch repair related MutLβ complex, Mlh1-Mlh2, specifically interacts with the conserved meiotic Mer3 helicase, which recruits it to recombination hotspots, independently of mismatch recognition. This recruitment is essential to limit gene conversion tract lengths genome-wide, without affecting crossover formation. Contrary to expectations, Mer3 helicase activity, proposed to extend the displacement loop (D-loop) recombination intermediate, does not influence the length of gene conversion events, revealing non-catalytical roles of Mer3. In addition, both purified Mer3 and MutLβ preferentially recognize D-loops, providing a mechanism for limiting gene conversion in vivo. These findings show that MutLβ is an integral part of a new regulatory step of meiotic recombination, which has implications to prevent rapid allele fixation and hotspot erosion in populations.</p>

            <p>ABC exporters pump substrates across the membrane by coupling ATP-driven movements of nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) to the transmembrane domains (TMDs), which switch between inward- and outward-facing (IF, OF) orientations. DEER measurements on the heterodimeric ABC exporter TM287/288 from <em>Thermotoga maritima</em>, which contains a non-canonical ATP binding site, revealed that in the presence of nucleotides the transporter exists in an IF/OF equilibrium. While ATP binding was sufficient to partially populate the OF state, nucleotide trapping in the pre- or post-hydrolytic state was required for a pronounced conformational shift. At physiologically high temperatures and in the absence of nucleotides, the NBDs disengage asymmetrically while the conformation of the TMDs remains unchanged. Nucleotide binding at the degenerate ATP site prevents complete NBD separation, a molecular feature differentiating heterodimeric from homodimeric ABC exporters. Our data suggest hydrolysis-independent closure of the NBD dimer, which is further stabilized as the consensus site nucleotide is committed to hydrolysis.</p>

            <p>The molecular mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive deficits are not yet fully elucidated. In aged animals, a decrease in the intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons is believed to contribute to age-related cognitive impairments. Increasing activity of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in young adult rodents facilitates cognition, and increases intrinsic excitability. However, it has yet to be tested if increasing CREB expression also ameliorates age-related behavioral and biophysical deficits. To test this hypothesis, we virally overexpressed CREB in CA1 of dorsal hippocampus. Rats received CREB or control virus, before undergoing water maze training. CREB overexpression in aged animals ameliorated the long-term memory deficits observed in control animals. Concurrently, cells overexpressing CREB in aged animals had reduced post-burst afterhyperpolarizations, indicative of increased intrinsic excitability.

            An important aspect of animal perception and cognition is learning to recognize relationships between environmental events that predict others in time, a form of relational knowledge that can be assessed using sequence-learning paradigms. Humans are exquisitely sensitive to sequencing relationships, and their combinatorial capacities, most saliently in the domain of language, are unparalleled. Recent comparative research in human and nonhuman primates has obtained behavioral and neuroimaging evidence for evolutionarily conserved substrates involved in sequence processing.

            Real-time activity measurements of genetically identified neuroendocrine vasopressin neurons show they can anticipate osmotic challenges. In this issue of Neuron, Mandelblat-Cerf et al. (2017) show that correlating these results with ongoing behavior and plasma osmolality points to the existence of brain networks that integrate exterosensory cues with interosensory signals to drive neuroendocrine output.

            <p>It has long been thought that the life cycle of <em>Streptomyces</em> bacteria encompasses three developmental stages: vegetative hyphae, aerial hyphae and spores. Here, we show interactions between <em>Streptomyces</em> and fungi trigger a previously unobserved mode of <em>Streptomyces</em> development. We term these <em>Streptomyces</em> cells ‘explorers’, for their ability to adopt a non-branching vegetative hyphal conformation and rapidly transverse solid surfaces. Fungi trigger <em>Streptomyces</em> exploratory growth in part by altering the composition of the growth medium, and <em>Streptomyces</em> explorer cells can communicate this exploratory behaviour to other physically separated streptomycetes using an airborne volatile organic compound (VOC). These results reveal that interkingdom interactions can trigger novel developmental behaviours in bacteria, here, causing <em>Streptomyces</em> to deviate from its classically-defined life cycle. Furthermore, this work provides evidence that VOCs can act as long-range communication signals capable of propagating microbial morphological switches.</p>

            <p>Populations are often divided categorically into distinct racial/ethnic groups based on social rather than biological constructs. Genetic ancestry has been suggested as an alternative to this categorization. Herein, we typed over 450,000 CpG sites in whole blood of 573 individuals of diverse Hispanic origin who also had high-density genotype data. We found that both self-identified ethnicity and genetically determined ancestry were each significantly associated with methylation levels at 916 and 194 CpGs, respectively, and that shared genomic ancestry accounted for a median of 75.7% (IQR 45.8% to 92%) of the variance in methylation associated with ethnicity. There was a significant enrichment (p=4.2×10<sup>-64</sup>) of ethnicity-associated sites amongst loci previously associated environmental exposures, particularly maternal smoking during pregnancy. We conclude that differential methylation between ethnic groups is partially explained by the shared genetic ancestry but that environmental factors not captured by ancestry significantly contribute to variation in methylation.</p>

            <p>hIAPP fibrils are associated with Type-II Diabetes, but the link of hIAPP structure to islet cell death remains elusive. Here we observe that hIAPP fibrils are cytotoxic to cultured pancreatic β-cells, leading us to determine the structure and cytotoxicity of protein segments composing the amyloid spine of hIAPP. Using the cryoEM method MicroED, we discover that one segment, 19–29 S20G, forms pairs of β-sheets mated by a dry interface that share structural features with and are similarly cytotoxic to full-length hIAPP fibrils. In contrast, a second segment, 15–25 WT, forms non-toxic labile β-sheets. These segments possess different structures and cytotoxic effects, however, both can seed full-length hIAPP, and cause hIAPP to take on the cytotoxic and structural features of that segment. These results suggest that protein segment structures represent polymorphs of their parent protein and that segment 19–29 S20G may serve as a model for the toxic spine of hIAPP.</p>

Here, combining the biochemical analysis of enzymatic and motile properties for purified myosin mutants with in vivo measurements of apical constriction for the same mutants, we show that in vivo constriction rate scales with myosin motor activity. We show that so-called phosphomimetic mutants of the <em>Drosophila</em> regulatory light chain (RLC) do not mimic the phosphorylated RLC state in vitro. The defect in the myosin motor activity in these mutants is evident in developing <em>Drosophila</em> embryos where tissue recoil following laser ablation is decreased compared to wild-type tissue. Overall, our data highlights that myosin activity is required for rapid cell contraction and tissue folding in developing <em>Drosophila</em> embryos.</p>

            <p>The IL-2/IL-2Ralpha (CD25) axis is of central importance for the interplay of effector and regulatory T cells. Nevertheless, the question how different antigen loads are translated into appropriate IL-2 production to ensure adequate responses against pathogens remains largely unexplored. Here we find that at single cell level, IL-2 is binary (digital) and CD25 is graded expressed whereas at population level both parameters show graded expression correlating with the antigen amount. Combining in vivo data with a mathematical model we demonstrate that only this binary IL-2 expression ensures a wide linear antigen response range for Teff and Treg cells under real spatiotemporal conditions. Furthermore, at low antigen concentrations binary IL-2 expression safeguards by its spatial distribution selective STAT5 activation only of closely adjacent Treg cells regardless of their antigen specificity. These data show that the mode of IL-2 secretion is critical to tailor the adaptive immune response to the antigen amount.</p>

            <p>Nervous system function requires intracellular transport of channels, receptors, mRNAs, and other cargo throughout complex neuronal morphologies. Local signals such as synaptic input can regulate cargo trafficking, motivating the leading conceptual model of neuron-wide transport, sometimes called the ‘sushi-belt model’ (Doyle and Kiebler, 2011). Current theories and experiments are based on this model, yet its predictions are not rigorously understood. We formalized the sushi belt model mathematically, and show that it can achieve arbitrarily complex spatial distributions of cargo in reconstructed morphologies. However, the model also predicts an unavoidable, morphology dependent tradeoff between speed, precision and metabolic efficiency of cargo transport. With experimental estimates of trafficking kinetics, the model predicts delays of many hours or days for modestly accurate and efficient cargo delivery throughout a dendritic tree. These findings challenge current understanding of the efficacy of nucleus-to-synapse trafficking and may explain the prevalence of local biosynthesis in neurons.</p>

            <p>Experience-dependent reorganisation of functional maps in the cerebral cortex is well described in the primary sensory cortices. However, there is relatively little evidence for such cortical reorganisation over the short-term. Using human somatosensory cortex as a model, we investigated the effects of a 24 hr gluing manipulation in which the right index and right middle fingers (digits 2 and 3) were adjoined with surgical glue. Somatotopic representations, assessed with two 7 tesla fMRI protocols, revealed rapid off-target reorganisation in the non-manipulated fingers following gluing, with the representation of the ring finger (digit 4) shifted towards the little finger (digit 5) and away from the middle finger (digit 3). These shifts were also evident in two behavioural tasks conducted in an independent cohort, showing reduced sensitivity for discriminating the temporal order of stimuli to the ring and little fingers, and increased substitution errors across this pair on a speeded reaction time task.</p>

            Although the importance of network connectivity is increasingly recognized, identifying synapses remains challenging relative to the routine characterization of neuronal morphology. Thus, researchers frequently employ axon–dendrite colocations as proxies of potential connections. This putative equivalence, commonly referred to as Peters’ rule, has been recently studied at multiple levels and scales, fueling passionate debates regarding its validity. Our critical literature review identifies three conceptually distinct but often confused applications: inferring neuron type circuitry, predicting synaptic contacts among individual cells, and estimating synapse numbers within neuron pairs.

            The nervous systems of cnidarians, pre-bilaterian animals that diverged close to the base of the metazoan radiation, are structurally simple and thus have great potential to reveal fundamental principles of neural circuits. Unfortunately, cnidarians have thus far been relatively intractable to electrophysiological and genetic techniques and consequently have been largely passed over by neurobiologists. However, recent advances in molecular and imaging methods are fueling a renaissance of interest in and research into cnidarians nervous systems.

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><span class="underlined ">Objective</span>: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is a neurodegenerative spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) associated with an expanded polyglutamine tract within ataxin-3 for which there is currently no available therapy. We previously showed that caffeine, a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist, delays the appearance of striatal damage resulting from expression of full-length mutant ataxin-3. Here we investigated the ability of caffeine to alleviate behavioral deficits and cerebellar neuropathology in transgenic mice with a severe ataxia resulting from expression of a truncated fragment of polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-3 in Purkinje cells.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><span class="underlined ">Methods</span>: Control and transgenic c57Bl6 mice expressing in the mouse cerebella a truncated form of human ataxin-3 with 69 glutamine repeats, were allowed to freely drink water or caffeine (1 g/L). Treatments began at 7 weeks of age, when motor and ataxic phenotype emerges in MJD mice, and lasted up to 20 weeks. Mice were tested in a panel of locomotor behavioral paradigms, namely rotarod, beam balance and walking, pole and water maze cued-platform version tests and then sacrificed for cerebellar histology.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><span class="underlined ">Results</span>: Caffeine consumption attenuated the progressive loss of general and fine-tuned motor function, balance and grip strength, in parallel with a preservation of cerebellar morphology through decreasing the loss of Purkinje neurons and the thinning of the molecular layer in different folia. Caffeine also rescued the putative striatal-dependent executive and cognitive deficiencies in MJD mice.</p></div>

            <p>Visual cortical neurons are tuned to similar orientations through the two eyes. The binocularly-matched orientation preference is established during a critical period in early life, but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we optogenetically isolated the thalamocortical and intracortical excitatory inputs to individual layer 4 neurons and studied their binocular matching. In adult mice, the thalamic and cortical inputs representing the same eyes are similarly tuned and both are matched binocularly. In mice before the critical period, the thalamic input is already slightly matched, but the weak matching is not manifested due to random connections in the cortex, especially those serving the ipsilateral eye. Binocular matching is thus mediated by orientation-specific changes in intracortical connections and further improvement of thalamic matching. Together, our results suggest that the feed-forward thalamic input may play a key role in initiating and guiding the functional refinement of cortical circuits in critical period development.</p>

            <p>Despite their canonical two-fold symmetry, nucleosomes in biological contexts are often asymmetric: functionalized with post-translational modifications (PTMs), substituted with histone variants, and even lacking H2A/H2B dimers. Here we show that the Widom 601 nucleosome positioning sequence can produce hexasomes in a specific orientation on DNA, providing a useful tool for interrogating chromatin enzymes and allowing for the generation of nucleosomes with precisely defined asymmetry. Using this methodology, we demonstrate that the Chd1 chromatin remodeler from <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> requires H2A/H2B on the entry side for sliding, and thus, unlike the back-and-forth sliding observed for nucleosomes, Chd1 shifts hexasomes unidirectionally. Chd1 takes part in chromatin reorganization surrounding transcribing RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and using asymmetric nucleosomes we show that ubiquitin-conjugated H2B on the entry side stimulates nucleosome sliding by Chd1. We speculate that biased nucleosome and hexasome sliding due to asymmetry contributes to the packing of arrays observed in vivo.</p>

            <p>Existing theory, empirical, clinical and field research all predict that reducing the virulence of individuals within a pathogen population will reduce the overall virulence, rendering disease less severe. Here, we show that this seemingly successful disease management strategy can fail with devastating consequences for infected hosts. We deploy cooperation theory and a novel synthetic system involving the rice blast fungus <em>Magnaporthe oryzae</em>. In vivo infections of rice demonstrate that <em>M. oryzae</em> virulence is enhanced, quite paradoxically, when a public good mutant is present in a population of high-virulence pathogens. We reason that during infection, the fungus engages in multiple cooperative acts to exploit host resources. We establish a multi-trait cooperation model which suggests that the observed failure of the virulence reduction strategy is caused by the interference between different social traits. Multi-trait cooperative interactions are widespread, so we caution against the indiscriminant application of anti-virulence therapy as a disease-management strategy.</p>

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Autoimmune encephalitis, represented by anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (anti-LGI1) and anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis, has increasing clinical significance based on recent discoveries of neuronal autoantibodies. However, its immunopathogenesis is not fully understood. Here, we investigated whether autoimmune encephalitis is associated with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtypes.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: We compared the HLA genotypes of 11 anti-LGI1 and 17 anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients to the control groups, which consisted of 210 epilepsy patients and 485 healthy Koreans.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Anti-LGI1 encephalitis was associated with the DRB1*07:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype (10 patients, 91%) in HLA class II genes, as well as with B*44:03 (8 patients, 73%) and C*07:06 (7 patients, 64%) in the HLA class I region. The prevalence of these alleles in anti-LGI1 encephalitis was significantly higher than that in the epilepsy controls or healthy controls. By contrast, anti-NMDAR encephalitis was not associated with HLA genotypes. Additional analysis using HLA–peptide binding prediction algorithms and computational docking underpinned the close relationship.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: This finding suggests that most anti-LGI1 encephalitis develops in a population with specific HLA subtypes, providing insight into a novel disease mechanism. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease with severity ranging from progressive infantile paralysis and premature death (Type I) to limited motor neuron loss and normal life expectancy (Type IV). Without disease–modifying therapies, the impact is profound for patients and their families. Improved understanding of the molecular basis of SMA, disease pathogenesis, natural history and recognition of the impact of standardized care on outcomes has yielded progress towards the development of novel therapeutic strategies and are summarised. Therapeutic strategies in the pipeline are appraised, ranging from <em>SMN1</em> gene replacement to modulation of <em>SMN2</em> encoded transcripts, to neuroprotection, to an expanding repertoire of peripheral targets, including muscle. With the advent of preliminary trial data, it can be reasonably anticipated that the SMA treatment landscape will transform significantly. Advancement in presymptomatic diagnosis and screening programmes will be critical, with pilot newborn screening studies underway to facilitate preclinical diagnosis. The development of disease–modifying therapies will necessitate monitoring programmes to determine the long–term impact, careful evaluation of combined treatments and further acceleration of improvements in supportive care. In advance of upcoming clinical trial results, we consider the challenges and controversies related to the implementation of novel therapies for all patients and set the scene as the field prepares to enter an era of novel therapies.

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Leucine-rich glioma-inactivated1 (LGI1)-encephalitis is an antibody-associated inflammation of the limbic area. An autoimmune etiology is suspected but not proven yet. We performed HLA-analysis in 25 non-tumor anti-LGI1 patients and discovered a remarkably strong HLA-association. HLA-DR7 was present in 88% compared to 19.6% in healthy controls (p=4.1*10-11). HLA-DRB4 was present in all patients and in 46.5% controls (p=1.19*10-7). These findings support the autoimmune hypothesis. An exploratory analysis was performed in a small group of four tumor-LGI1 patients. The strong HLA association seems not applicable in these patients. Therefore, the absence of HLA-DR7 or HLA-DRB4 could raise tumor suspicion in anti-LGI1 patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

            Developmental brain plasticity involves complex, time-dependent dynamic molecular interactions that cannot be observed directly in humans. We propose that the shared evolutionary homology of teeth and the neurosensory system, and the archival nature of dentine microstructure, allows the development of ‘biologic hard drives’ that can characterize perinatal temporal dynamics in neuroplasticity.

            <p>Destabilization of a non-enveloped virus generates a membrane transport-competent viral particle. Here we probe polyomavirus SV40 endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-cytosol membrane transport, a decisive infection step where destabilization initiates this non-enveloped virus for membrane penetration. We find that a member of the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) called EMC1 promotes SV40 ER membrane transport and infection. Surprisingly, EMC1 does so by using its predicted transmembrane residue D961 to bind to and stabilize the membrane-embedded partially destabilized SV40, thereby preventing premature viral disassembly. EMC1-dependent stabilization enables SV40 to engage a cytosolic extraction complex that ejects the virus into the cytosol. Thus EMC1 acts as a molecular chaperone, bracing the destabilized SV40 in a transport-competent state. Our findings reveal the novel principle that coordinated destabilization-stabilization drives membrane transport of a non-enveloped virus.</p>

            <p>Stable kinetochore-microtubule attachment is essential for cell division. It requires recruitment of outer kinetochore microtubule binders by centromere proteins C and T (CENP-C and CENP-T). To study the molecular requirements of kinetochore formation, we reconstituted the binding of the MIS12 and NDC80 outer kinetochore subcomplexes to CENP-C and CENP-T. Whereas CENP-C recruits a single MIS12:NDC80 complex, we show here that CENP-T binds one MIS12:NDC80 and two NDC80 complexes upon phosphorylation by the mitotic CDK1:Cyclin B complex at three distinct CENP-T sites. Visualization of reconstituted complexes by electron microscopy supports this model. Binding of CENP-C and CENP-T to MIS12 is competitive, and therefore CENP-C and CENP-T act in parallel to recruit two MIS12 and up to four NDC80 complexes. Our observations provide a molecular explanation for the stoichiometry of kinetochore components and its cell cycle regulation, and highlight how outer kinetochore modules bridge distances of well over 100 nm.</p>

            <p>Interneurons are critical for proper neural network function and can activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in astrocytes. However, the impact of the interneuron-astrocyte signaling into neuronal network operation remains unknown. Using the simplest hippocampal Astrocyte-Neuron network, i.e., GABAergic interneuron, pyramidal neuron, single CA3-CA1 glutamatergic synapse, and astrocytes, we found that interneuron-astrocyte signaling dynamically affected excitatory neurotransmission in an activity- and time-dependent manner, and determined the sign (inhibition <em>vs</em> potentiation) of the GABA-mediated effects. While synaptic inhibition was mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, potentiation involved astrocyte GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, astrocytic glutamate release, and presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors. Using conditional astrocyte-specific GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor (<em>Gabbr1</em>) knockout mice, we confirmed the glial source of the interneuron-induced potentiation, and demonstrated the involvement of astrocytes in hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations in vivo. Therefore, astrocytes decode interneuron activity and transform inhibitory into excitatory signals, contributing to the emergence of novel network properties resulting from the interneuron-astrocyte interplay.</p>

            <p>Our previous paper (Wilkinson <em>et al</em>, 2016) used high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy to solve the structure of the <em>Escherichia coli</em> RecBCD complex, which acts in both the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks and the degradation of bacteriophage DNA. To counteract the latter activity, bacteriophage λ encodes a small protein inhibitor called Gam that binds to RecBCD and inactivates the complex. Here, we show that Gam inhibits RecBCD by competing at the DNA-binding site. The interaction surface is extensive and involves molecular mimicry of the DNA substrate. We also show that expression of Gam in <em>E. coli</em> or <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> increases sensitivity to fluoroquinolones; antibacterials that kill cells by inhibiting topoisomerases and inducing double-stranded DNA breaks. Furthermore, fluoroquinolone-resistance in <em>K. pneumoniae</em> clinical isolates is reversed by expression of Gam. Together, our data explain the synthetic lethality observed between topoisomerase-induced DNA breaks and the RecBCD gene products, suggesting a new co-antibacterial strategy.</p>

            <p>The primary task of developing embryos is genome replication, yet how DNA replication is integrated with the profound cellular changes that occur through development is largely unknown. Using an approach to map DNA replication at high resolution in <em>C. elegans</em>, we show that replication origins are marked with specific histone modifications that define gene enhancers. We demonstrate that the level of enhancer associated modifications scale with the efficiency at which the origin is utilized. By mapping replication origins at different developmental stages, we show that the positions and activity of origins is largely invariant through embryogenesis. Contrary to expectation, we find that replication origins are specified prior to the broad onset of zygotic transcription, yet when transcription initiates it does so in close proximity to the pre-defined replication origins. Transcription and DNA replication origins are correlated, but the association breaks down when embryonic cell division ceases. Collectively, our data indicate that replication origins are fundamental organizers and regulators of gene activity through embryonic development.</p>

            <p>Internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) are important RNA-based translation initiation signals, critical for infection by many pathogenic viruses. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES is the prototype for the type 3 IRESs and is also invaluable for exploring principles of eukaryotic translation initiation, in general. Current mechanistic models for the type 3 IRESs are useful but they also present paradoxes, including how they can function both with and without eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2. We discovered that eIF1A is necessary for efficient activity where it stabilizes tRNA binding and inspects the codon-anticodon interaction, especially important in the IRES’ eIF2-independent mode. These data support a model in which the IRES binds preassembled translation preinitiation complexes and remodels them to generate eukaryotic initiation complexes with bacterial-like features. This model explains previous data, reconciles eIF2-dependent and -independent pathways, and illustrates how RNA structure-based control can respond to changing cellular conditions.</p>

            <p>Although free-living and obligate intracellular bacteria are both polarized it is unclear whether the underlying polarization mechanisms and effector proteins are conserved. Here we dissect at the cytological, functional and structural level a conserved polarization module from the free living α-proteobacterium <em>Caulobacter crescentus</em> and an orthologous system from an obligate intracellular (rickettsial) pathogen. The NMR solution structure of the zinc-finger (ZnR) domain from the bifunctional and bipolar ZitP pilus assembly/motility regulator revealed conserved interaction determinants for PopZ, a bipolar matrix protein that anchors the ParB centromere-binding protein and other regulatory factors at the poles. We show that ZitP regulates cytokinesis and the localization of ParB and PopZ, targeting PopZ independently of the previously known binding sites for its client proteins. Through heterologous localization assays with rickettsial ZitP and PopZ orthologs, we document the shared ancestries, activities and structural determinants of a (bi-)polarization system encoded in free-living and obligate intracellular α-proteobacteria.</p>

            <p>Bacterial Xer site-specific recombinases play an essential genome maintenance role by unlinking chromosome multimers, but their mechanism of action has remained structurally uncharacterized. Here, we present two high-resolution structures of <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> XerH with its recombination site DNA <em>dif<sub>H</sub></em>, representing pre-cleavage and post-cleavage synaptic intermediates in the recombination pathway. The structures reveal that activation of DNA strand cleavage and rejoining involves large conformational changes and DNA bending, suggesting how interaction with the cell division protein FtsK may license recombination at the septum. Together with biochemical and in vivo analysis, our structures also reveal how a small sequence asymmetry in <em>dif<sub>H</sub></em> defines protein conformation in the synaptic complex and orchestrates the order of DNA strand exchanges. Our results provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of Xer recombination and a model for regulation of recombination activity during cell division.</p>

            <p>Understanding how fungi specialize on their plant host is crucial for developing sustainable disease control. A traditional, centuries-old rice agro-system of the Yuanyang terraces was used as a model to show that virulence effectors of the rice blast fungus <em>Magnaporthe oryzaeh</em> play a key role in its specialization on locally grown indica or japonica local rice subspecies. Our results have indicated that major differences in several components of basal immunity and effector-triggered immunity of the japonica and indica rice varieties are associated with specialization of <em>M. oryzae</em>. These differences thus play a key role in determining <em>M. oryzae</em> host specificity and may limit the spread of the pathogen within the Yuanyang agro-system. Specifically, the AVR-Pia effector has been identified as a possible determinant of the specialization of <em>M. oryzae</em> to local japonica rice.</p>

            <p>Cytosolic Ric-8A has guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity and is a chaperone for several classes of heterotrimeric G protein α subunits in vertebrates. Using Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange-Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) we show that Ric-8A disrupts the secondary structure of the Gα Ras-like domain that girds the guanine nucleotide-binding site, and destabilizes the interface between the Gαi1 Ras and helical domains, allowing domain separation and nucleotide release. These changes are largely reversed upon binding GTP and dissociation of Ric-8A. HDX-MS identifies a potential Gα interaction site in Ric-8A. Alanine scanning reveals residues crucial for GEF activity within that sequence. HDX confirms that, like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), Ric-8A binds the C-terminus of Gα. In contrast to GPCRs, Ric-8A interacts with Switches I and II of Gα and possibly at the Gα domain interface. These extensive interactions provide both allosteric and direct catalysis of GDP unbinding and release and GTP binding.</p>

            <p>Protein polarization underlies differentiation in metazoans and in bacteria. How symmetric polarization can instate functional asymmetry remains elusive. Here, we show by super-resolution photo-activated localization microscopy and edgetic mutations that the bitopic zinc-finger protein ZitP implements specialized developmental functions – pilus biogenesis and multifactorial swarming motility – while shaping distinct nanoscale (bi)polar architectures in the asymmetric model bacterium <em>Caulobacter crescentus</em>. Polar assemblage and accumulation of ZitP and its effector protein CpaM are orchestrated in time and space by conserved components of the cell cycle circuitry that coordinate polar morphogenesis with cell cycle progression, and also act on the master cell cycle regulator CtrA. Thus, this novel class of potentially widespread multifunctional polarity regulators is deeply embedded in the cell cycle circuitry.</p>

            <p>Reward perception guides all aspects of animal behavior. However, the relationship between the perceived value of a reward, the latent value of a reward, and the behavioral response remains unclear. Here we report that, given a choice between two sweet and chemically similar sugars—L- and D-arabinose—<em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> prefers D- over L- arabinose, but forms long-term memories of L-arabinose more reliably. Behavioral assays indicate that L-arabinose-generated memories require sugar receptor Gr43a, and calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings indicate that L- and D-arabinose differentially activate Gr43a-expressing neurons. We posit that the immediate valence of a reward is not always predictive of the long-term reinforcement value of that reward, and that a subset of sugar-sensing neurons may generate distinct representations of similar sugars, allowing for rapid assessment of the salient features of various sugar rewards and generation of reward-specific behaviors. However, how sensory neurons communicate information about L-arabinose quality and concentration—features relevant for long-term memory—remains unknown.</p>

            <p>Mechanisms underlying the vein development remain largely unknown. Tie2 signaling mediates endothelial cell (EC) survival and vascular maturation and its activating mutations are linked to venous malformations. Here we show that vein formation are disrupted in mouse skin and mesentery when Tie2 signals are diminished by targeted deletion of <em>Tek</em> either ubiquitously or specifically in embryonic ECs. Postnatal Tie2 attenuation resulted in the degeneration of newly formed veins followed by the formation of haemangioma-like vascular tufts in retina and venous tortuosity. Mechanistically, Tie2 insufficiency compromised venous EC identity, as indicated by a significant decrease of COUP-TFII protein level, a key regulator in venogenesis. Consistently, angiopoietin-1 stimulation increased COUP-TFII in cultured ECs, while Tie2 knockdown or blockade of Tie2 downstream PI3K/Akt pathway reduced COUP-TFII which could be reverted by the proteasome inhibition. Together, our results imply that Tie2 is essential for venous specification and maintenance via Akt mediated stabilization of COUP-TFII.</p>

            <p>Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) pattern the dorsal-ventral axis of bilaterian embryos; however, their roles in the evolution of body plan are largely unknown. We examined their functional evolution in fly embryos. BMP signaling specifies two extraembryonic tissues, the serosa and amnion, in basal-branching flies such as <em>Megaselia abdita</em>, but only one, the amnioserosa, in <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>. The BMP signaling dynamics are similar in both species until the beginning of gastrulation, when BMP signaling broadens and intensifies at the edge of the germ rudiment in <em>Megaselia</em>, while remaining static in <em>Drosophila</em>. Here we show that the differences in gradient dynamics and tissue specification result from evolutionary changes in the gene regulatory network that controls the activity of a positive feedback circuit on BMP signaling, involving the <em>tumor necrosis factor alpha</em> homolog <em>eiger</em>. These data illustrate an evolutionary mechanism by which spatiotemporal changes in morphogen gradients can guide tissue complexity.</p>

            <p>Animals and humans have a tendency to repeat recent choices, a phenomenon known as choice hysteresis. The mechanism for this choice bias remains unclear. Using an established, biophysically informed model of a competitive attractor network for decision making, we found that decaying tail activity from the previous trial caused choice hysteresis, especially during difficult trials, and accurately predicted human perceptual choices. In the model, choice variability could be directionally altered through amplification or dampening of post-trial activity decay through simulated depolarizing or hyperpolarizing network stimulation. An analogous intervention using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) yielded a close match between model predictions and experimental results: net soma depolarizing currents increased choice hysteresis, while hyperpolarizing currents suppressed it. Residual activity in competitive attractor networks within dlPFC may thus give rise to biases in perceptual choices, which can be directionally controlled through non-invasive brain stimulation.</p>

            <p>Mature seed dormancy is a vital plant trait that prevents germination out of season. In <em>Arabidopsis</em>, the trait can be maternally regulated but the underlying mechanisms sustaining this regulation, its general occurrence and its biological significance among accessions are poorly understood. Upon seed imbibition, the endosperm is essential to repress the germination of dormant seeds. Investigation of genomic imprinting in the mature seed endosperm led us to identify a novel set of imprinted genes that are expressed upon seed imbibition. Remarkably, programs of imprinted gene expression are adapted according to the dormancy status of the seed. We provide direct evidence that imprinted genes play a role in regulating germination processes and that preferential maternal allelic expression can implement maternal inheritance of seed dormancy levels.</p>

            <p>The second messenger c-di-GMP (or cyclic diguanylate) regulates biofilm formation, a physiological adaptation process in bacteria, via a widely conserved signaling node comprising a prototypical transmembrane receptor for c-di-GMP, LapD, and a cognate periplasmic protease, LapG. Previously, we reported a structure-function study of a soluble LapD•LapG complex, which established conformational changes in the receptor that lead to c-di-GMP-dependent protease recruitment (Chatterjee et al., 2014). This work also revealed a basal affinity of c-di-GMP-unbound receptor for LapG, the relevance of which remained enigmatic. Here, we elucidate the structural basis of coincidence detection that relies on both c-di-GMP and LapG binding to LapD for receptor activation. The data indicate that high-affinity for LapG relies on the formation of a receptor dimer-of-dimers, rather than a simple conformational change within dimeric LapD. The proposed mechanism provides a rationale of how external proteins can regulate receptor function and may also apply to c-di-GMP-metabolizing enzymes that are akin to LapD.</p>

            <p>A molecular model that provides a framework for interpreting the wealth of functional information obtained on the <em>E. coli</em> F-ATP synthase has been generated using cryo-electron microscopy. Three different states that relate to rotation of the enzyme were observed, with the central stalk’s ε subunit in an extended autoinhibitory conformation in all three states. The F<sub>o</sub> motor comprises of seven transmembrane helices and a decameric c-ring and invaginations on either side of the membrane indicate the entry and exit channels for protons. The proton translocating subunit contains near parallel helices inclined by ~30° to the membrane, a feature now synonymous with rotary ATPases. For the first time in this rotary ATPase subtype, the peripheral stalk is resolved over its entire length of the complex, revealing the F<sub>1</sub> attachment points and a coiled-coil that bifurcates toward the membrane with its helices separating to embrace subunit <em>a</em> from two sides.</p>

            <p>Previously we reported that Src-associated-substrate-during-mitosis-of-68kDa (Sam68/KHDRBS1) is pivotal for DNA damage-stimulated NF-κB transactivation of anti-apoptotic genes (Fu et al., 2016). Here we show that Sam68 is critical for genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB activation in the γ-irradiated colon and animal and that Sam68-dependent NF-κB activation provides radioprotection to colon epithelium in vivo. Sam68 deletion diminishes γ-irradiation-triggered PAR synthesis and NF-κB activation in colon epithelial cells (CECs), thus hampering the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules in situ and facilitating CECs to undergo apoptosis in mice post whole-body γ-irradiation (WBIR). Sam68 knockout mice suffer more severe damage in the colon and succumb more rapidly from acute radiotoxicity than the control mice following WBIR. Our results underscore the critical role of Sam68 in orchestrating genotoxic stress-initiated NF-κB activation signaling in the colon tissue and whole animal and reveal the pathophysiological relevance of Sam68-dependent NF-κB activation in colonic cell survival and recovery from extrinsic DNA damage.</p>

            <p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an element of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuitry critical for action suppression. In Huntington's disease (HD) action suppression is impaired, resembling the effects of STN lesioning or inactivation. To explore this potential linkage, the STN was studied in BAC transgenic and Q175 knock-in mouse models of HD. At ATP channels. STN neurons exhibited prolonged NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents, caused by a deficit in glutamate uptake, and elevated mitochondrial oxidant stress, which was ameliorated by NMDA receptor antagonism. STN activity was rescued by NMDA receptor antagonism or the break down of hydrogen peroxide. At 12 months of age approximately 30% of STN neurons had been lost, as in HD. Together, these data argue that dysfunction within the STN is an early feature of HD that may contribute to its expression and course.</p>

            <p>Mitochondrial dysfunction underlies many prevalent diseases including heart disease arising from acute ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Here, we demonstrate that mitophagy, which selectively removes damaged or unwanted mitochondria, regulated mitochondrial quality and quantity <em>in vivo</em>. Hypoxia induced extensive mitochondrial degradation in a FUNDC1-dependent manner in platelets, and this was blocked by <em>in vivo</em> administration of a cell-penetrating peptide encompassing the LIR motif of FUNDC1 only in wild-type mice. Genetic ablation of Fundc1 impaired mitochondrial quality and increased mitochondrial mass in platelets and rendered the platelets insensitive to hypoxia and the peptide. Moreover, hypoxic mitophagy in platelets protected the heart from worsening of I/R injury. This represents a new mechanism of the hypoxic preconditioning effect which reduces I/R injury. Our results demonstrate a critical role of mitophagy in mitochondrial quality control and platelet activation, and suggest that manipulation of mitophagy by hypoxia or pharmacological approaches may be a novel strategy for cardioprotection.</p>

            <p>When 2 Mha of Amazonian forests are disturbed by selective logging each year, more than 90 Tg of carbon (C) is emitted to the atmosphere. Emissions are then counterbalanced by forest regrowth. With an original modelling approach, calibrated on a network of 133 permanent forest plots (175 ha total) across Amazonia, we link regional differences in climate, soil and initial biomass with survivors’ and recruits’ C fluxes to provide Amazon-wide predictions of post-logging C recovery. We show that net aboveground C recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield and in the west (21 <span class="inline-formula"><span class="mathjax mml-math"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>±</mo></math></span></span>3 Mg C ha<span class="inline-formula"><span class="mathjax mml-math"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mi></mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></math></span></span>) than in the south (12 <span class="inline-formula"><span class="mathjax mml-math"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>±</mo></math></span></span>3 Mg C ha<span class="inline-formula"><span class="mathjax mml-math"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mi></mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></math></span></span>) where environmental stress is high (low rainfall, high seasonality).

            <p>Although the role of CCR5 in immunity and in HIV infection has been studied widely, its role in neuronal plasticity, learning and memory is not understood. Here, we report that decreasing the function of CCR5 increases MAPK/CREB signaling, long-term potentiation (LTP), and hippocampus-dependent memory in mice, while neuronal CCR5 overexpression caused memory deficits. Decreasing CCR5 function in mouse barrel cortex also resulted in enhanced spike timing dependent plasticity and consequently, dramatically accelerated experience-dependent plasticity. These results suggest that CCR5 is a powerful suppressor for plasticity and memory, and CCR5 over-activation by viral proteins may contribute to HIV-associated cognitive deficits. Consistent with this hypothesis, the HIV V3 peptide caused LTP, signaling and memory deficits that were prevented by Ccr5 knockout or knockdown. Overall, our results demonstrate that CCR5 plays an important role in neuroplasticity, learning and memory, and indicate that CCR5 has a role in the cognitive deficits caused by HIV.</p>

            <p>The regeneration-capable flatworm <em>Macrostomum lignano</em> is a powerful model organism to study the biology of stem cells in vivo. As a flatworm amenable to transgenesis, it complements the historically used planarian flatworm models, such as <em>Schmidtea mediterranea</em>. However, information on the transcriptome and markers of stem cells in <em>M. lignano</em> is limited. We generated a de novo transcriptome assembly and performed the first comprehensive characterization of gene expression in the proliferating cells of <em>M. lignano</em>, represented by somatic stem cells, called neoblasts, and germline cells. Knockdown of a selected set of neoblast genes, including <em>Mlig-ddx39</em>, <em>Mlig-rrm1</em>, <em>Mlig-rpa3</em>, <em>Mlig-cdk1</em>, and <em>Mlig-h2a</em>, confirmed their crucial role for the functionality of somatic neoblasts during homeostasis and regeneration. The generated <em>M. lignano</em> transcriptome assembly and gene expression signatures of somatic neoblasts and germline cells will be a valuable resource for future molecular studies in <em>M. lignano</em>.</p>

            <p>Genetic variations in the myeloid immune receptor TREM2 are linked to several neurodegenerative diseases. To determine how TREM2 variants contribute to these diseases, we performed structural and functional studies of wild-type and variant proteins. Our 3.1 Å TREM2 crystal structure revealed that mutations found in Nasu-Hakola disease are buried whereas Alzheimer’s disease risk variants are found on the surface, suggesting that these mutations have distinct effects on TREM2 function. Biophysical and cellular methods indicate that Nasu-Hakola mutations impact protein stability and decrease folded TREM2 surface expression, whereas Alzheimer’s risk variants impact binding to a TREM2 ligand. Additionally, the Alzheimer’s risk variants appear to epitope map a functional surface on TREM2 that is unique within the larger TREM family. These findings provide a guide to structural and functional differences among genetic variants of TREM2, indicating that therapies targeting the TREM2 pathway should be tailored to these genetic and functional differences with patient-specific medicine approaches for neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
