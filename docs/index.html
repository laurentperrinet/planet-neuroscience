            <p>by Renaud Berlemont, Adam C. Martiny</p>

Across many environments microbial glycoside hydrolases support the enzymatic processing of carbohydrates, a critical function in many ecosystems. Little is known about how the microbial composition of a community and the potential for carbohydrate processing relate to each other. Here, using 1,934 metagenomic datasets, we linked changes in community composition to variation of potential for carbohydrate processing across environments. We were able to show that each ecosystem-type displays a specific potential for carbohydrate utilization. Most of this potential was associated with just 77 bacterial genera. The GH content in bacterial genera is best described by their taxonomic affiliation. Across metagenomes, fluctuations of the microbial community structure and GH potential for carbohydrate utilization were correlated. Our analysis reveals that both deterministic and stochastic processes contribute to the assembly of complex microbial communities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cbcWxM-KhM4" width="1" />

<div class="section" id="ana24825-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>Consecutive patients with clinically probable DLB (n = 19) from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center underwent magnetic resonance imaging, AV-1451, and Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) PET examinations. Age- and sex-matched groups of AD dementia (n = 19) patients and clinically normal controls (n = 95) from an epidemiological cohort served as a comparison groups. Atlas- and voxel-based analyses were performed.</p></div></div>

            Episodic memory, our ability to remember specific events, varies considerably across individuals. However, little is known about the neural basis of this variability. To address this issue, we investigated the role of distributed networks of oscillatory activity, as measured through electroencephalography (EEG). We observed that individual differences in alpha network structure reliably predict individual memory capacity. Specifically, individuals whose network profiles during encoding were most different from their resting state networks exhibited greatest subsequent memory performance, suggesting that optimal information processing requires substantial shifts in large-scale oscillatory organization. Furthermore, these results were not observed in circumscribed topographical regions or individual connections, indicating that distributed network approaches were more sensitive to functional processes than more conventional methods. These findings uncover a physiological correlate of individual differences in episodic memory and demonstrate the utility of multivariate EEG techniques to uncover brain-behavior correlates.

            Labeling and visualizing cells and sub-cellular structures within thick tissues, whole organs and even intact animals is key to studying biological processes. This is particularly true for studies of neural circuits where neurons form sub-micron synapses but have arbors that may span millimeters in length. Traditionally labeling is achieved by immunofluorescence; however diffusion of antibody molecules (&gt;100 kDa) is slow and often results in uneven labeling with very poor penetration into the centre of thick specimens; these limitations can be partially addressed by extending staining protocols to over a week (Drosophila brain) and months (mice). Recently we developed an alternative approach using genetically encoded chemical tags CLIP, SNAP, Halo and TMP for tissue labeling; this resulted in &gt;100 fold increase in labeling speed in both mice and Drosophila, at the expense of a considerable drop in absolute sensitivity when compared to optimized immunofluorescence staining. We now present a second generation of UAS and LexA responsive CLIP, SNAP and Halo chemical labeling reagents for flies. These multimerized tags with translational enhancers have up to 64 fold increase in sensitivity over first generation reagents. In addition we developed a suite of conditional reporters (4xSNAP tag and CLIP-SNAP-Halo) that are activated by the DNA recombinase Bxb1. Our new reporters can be used with weak and strong GAL4 and LexA drivers and enable stochastic, intersectional and multicolor Brainbow labeling. These improvements in sensitivity and experimental versatility, while still retaining the substantial speed advantage that is a signature of chemical labeling, should significantly increase the scope of this technology.

            Perceptual decisions vary in the speed at which we make them. Evidence suggests that translating sensory information into behavioral decisions relies on distributed interacting neural populations, with decision speed hinging on power modulations of neural oscillations. Yet, the dependence of perceptual decisions on the large-scale network organization of coupled neural oscillations has remained elusive. We measured magnetoencephalography signals in human listeners who judged acoustic stimuli made of carefully titrated clouds of tone sweeps. These stimuli were used under two task contexts where the participants judged the overall pitch or direction of the tone sweeps. We traced the large-scale network dynamics of source-projected neural oscillations on a trial-by-trial basis using power envelope correlations and graph-theoretical network discovery. Under both tasks, faster decisions were predicted by higher segregation and lower integration of coupled beta-band (~16-28 Hz) oscillations. We also uncovered brain network states that promoted faster decisions and emerged from lower-order auditory and higher-order control brain areas. Specifically, decision speed in judging tone-sweep direction critically relied on nodal network configurations of anterior temporal, cingulate and middle frontal cortices. Our findings suggest that global network communication during perceptual decision-making is implemented in the human brain by large-scale couplings between beta-band neural oscillations.

            Background: Given multiple studies of brain microRNA (miRNA) in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD) with few consistent results and the heterogeneity of this disease, the objective of this study was to explore their mechanism by evaluating their relation to different elements of Alzheimer's disease pathology, confounding factors and mRNA expression data from the same subjects in the same brain region. Results: We report analyses of expression profiling of miRNA (n=700 subjects) and lincRNA (n=540 subjects) from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of individuals participating in two longitudinal cohort studies of aging. Evaluating well-established (miR-132, miR-129), we confirm their association with pathologic AD in our dataset, and then characterize their in disease role in terms of neuritic {beta}-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Additionally, we identify one new miRNA (miR-99) and four lincRNA that are associated with these traits. Many other previously reported associations of microRNA with AD are associated with the confounders quantified in our longitudinal cohort. Finally, by performing analyses integrating both miRNA and RNA sequence data from the same individuals (525 samples), we characterize the impact of AD associated miRNA on human brain expression: we show that the effects of miR-132 and miR-129-5b converge on certain genes such as EP300 and find a role for miR200 and its target genes in AD using an integrated miRNA/mRNA analysis. Conclusions: Overall, miRNAs play a modest role in human AD, but we observe robust evidence that a small number of miRNAs are responsible for specific alterations in the cortical transcriptome that are associated with AD.

Connect omics has focused primarily on the mapping of synaptic links in the brain; yet it is well established that extra synaptic volume transmission, especially via monoamines and neuropeptides, is also critical to brain function and occurs primarily outside the synaptic connectome. We have mapped the putative monoamine connections, as well as a subset of neuropeptide connections, in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> based on new and published gene expression data. The monoamine and neuropeptide networks exhibit distinct topological properties, with the monoamine network displaying a highly dissertated star-like structure with a rich-club of interconnected broadcasting hubs, and the neuropeptide network showing a more recurrent, highly clustered topology. Despite the low degree of overlap between the extra synaptic (or wireless) and synaptic (or wired) connectomes, we find highly significant multilink motifs of interaction, pinpointing locations in the network where aminergic and neuropeptide signalling modulate synaptic activity. Thus, the <i>C elegans</i> connectome can be mapped as a multiplex network with synaptic, gap junction, and neuromodulator layers representing alternative modes of interaction between neurons. This provides a new topological plan for understanding how aminergic and peptidergic modulation of behaviour is achieved by specific motifs and loci of integration between hard-wired synaptic or junctional circuits and extra-synaptic signals wirelessly broadcast from a small number of modulatory neurons.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lS8pQJ5Xppw" width="1" />

            <p>by Andrew K. Smith, Brenden K. Petersen, Glen E. P. Ropella, Ryan C. Kennedy, Neil Kaplowitz, Murad Ookhtens, C. Anthony Hunt</p>

Acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice is a model for drug-induced liver injury in humans. A precondition for improved strategies to disrupt and/or reverse the damage is a credible explanatory mechanism for how toxicity phenomena emerge and converge to cause hepatic necrosis. The Target Phenomenon in mice is that necrosis begins adjacent to the lobule’s central vein (CV) and progresses outward. An explanatory mechanism remains elusive. Evidence supports that location dependent differences in NAPQI (the reactive metabolite) formation within hepatic lobules (NAPQI zonation) are necessary and sufficient prerequisites to account for that phenomenon. We call that the NZ-mechanism hypothesis. Challenging that hypothesis in mice is infeasible because 1) influential variables cannot be controlled, and 2) it would require sequential intracellular measurements at different lobular locations within the same mouse. Virtual hepatocytes use independently configured periportal-to-CV gradients to exhibit lobule-location dependent behaviors. Employing NZ-mechanism achieved quantitative validation targets for acetaminophen clearance and metabolism but failed to achieve the Target Phenomenon. We posited that, in order to do so, at least one additional feature must exhibit zonation by decreasing in the CV direction. We instantiated and explored two alternatives: 1) a glutathione depletion threshold diminishes in the CV direction; and 2) ability to repair mitochondrial damage diminishes in the CV direction. Inclusion of one or the other feature into NZ-mechanism failed to achieve the Target Phenomenon. However, inclusion of both features enabled successfully achieving the Target Phenomenon. The merged mechanism provides a multilevel, multiscale causal explanation of key temporal features of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in mice. We discovered that variants of the merged mechanism provide plausible quantitative explanations for the considerable variation in 24-hour necrosis scores among 37 genetically diverse mouse strains following a single toxic acetaminophen dose.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OTgYF713sKA" width="1" />

            <p>by Sébastien Raguideau, Sandra Plancade, Nicolas Pons, Marion Leclerc, Béatrice Laroche</p>

Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) metagenomics is increasingly used to study the structure and functions of complex microbial ecosystems, both from the taxonomic and functional point of view. Gene inventories of otherwise uncultured microbial communities make the direct functional profiling of microbial communities possible. The concept of community aggregated trait has been adapted from environmental and plant functional ecology to the framework of microbial ecology. Community aggregated traits are quantified from WGS data by computing the abundance of relevant marker genes. They can be used to study key processes at the ecosystem level and correlate environmental factors and ecosystem functions. In this paper we propose a novel model based approach to infer combinations of aggregated traits characterizing specific ecosystemic metabolic processes. We formulate a model of these Combined Aggregated Functional Traits (CAFTs) accounting for a hierarchical structure of genes, which are associated on microbial genomes, further linked at the ecosystem level by complex co-occurrences or interactions. The model is completed with constraints specifically designed to exploit available genomic information, in order to favor biologically relevant CAFTs. The CAFTs structure, as well as their intensity in the ecosystem, is obtained by solving a constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) problem. We developed a multicriteria selection procedure for the number of CAFTs. We illustrated our method on the modelling of ecosystemic functional traits of fiber degradation by the human gut microbiota. We used 1408 samples of gene abundances from several high-throughput sequencing projects and found that four CAFTs only were needed to represent the fiber degradation potential. This data reduction highlighted biologically consistent functional patterns while providing a high quality preservation of the original data. Our method is generic and can be applied to other metabolic processes in the gut or in other ecosystems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HygkdAtcBSY" width="1" />

            <p>by Matthew Huska, Martin Vingron</p>

Non-methylated islands (NMIs) of DNA are genomic regions that are important for gene regulation and development. A recent study of genome-wide non-methylation data in vertebrates by Long et al. (eLife 2013;2:e00348) has shown that many experimentally identified non-methylated regions do not overlap with classically defined CpG islands which are computationally predicted using simple DNA sequence features. This is especially true in cold-blooded vertebrates such as <i>Danio rerio</i> (zebrafish). In order to investigate how predictive DNA sequence is of a region’s methylation status, we applied a supervised learning approach using a spectrum kernel support vector machine, to see if a more complex model and supervised learning can be used to improve non-methylated island prediction and to understand the sequence properties of these regions. We demonstrate that DNA sequence is highly predictive of methylation status, and that in contrast to existing CpG island prediction methods our method is able to provide more useful predictions of NMIs genome-wide in all vertebrate organisms that were studied. Our results also show that in cold-blooded vertebrates (<i>Anolis carolinensis</i>, <i>Xenopus tropicalis</i> and <i>Danio rerio</i>) where genome-wide classical CpG island predictions consist primarily of false positives, longer primarily AT-rich DNA sequence features are able to identify these regions much more accurately.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5OrCgFgfOlA" width="1" />

            <p>by Marta Varela, Michael A. Colman, Jules C. Hancox, Oleg V. Aslanidi</p>

Anti-arrhythmic drug therapy is a frontline treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF), but its success rates are highly variable. This is due to incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of action of specific drugs on the atrial substrate at different stages of AF progression. We aimed to elucidate the role of cellular, tissue and organ level atrial heterogeneities in the generation of a re-entrant substrate during AF progression, and their modulation by the acute action of selected anti-arrhythmic drugs. To explore the complex cell-to-organ mechanisms, a detailed biophysical models of the entire 3D canine atria was developed. The model incorporated atrial geometry and fibre orientation from high-resolution micro-computed tomography, region-specific atrial cell electrophysiology and the effects of progressive AF-induced remodelling. The actions of multi-channel class III anti-arrhythmic agents vernakalant and amiodarone were introduced in the model by inhibiting appropriate ionic channel currents according to experimentally reported concentration-response relationships. AF was initiated by applied ectopic pacing in the pulmonary veins, which led to the generation of localized sustained re-entrant waves (rotors), followed by progressive wave breakdown and rotor multiplication in both atria. The simulated AF scenarios were in agreement with observations in canine models and patients. The 3D atrial simulations revealed that a re-entrant substrate was typically provided by tissue regions of high heterogeneity of action potential duration (APD). Amiodarone increased atrial APD and reduced APD heterogeneity and was more effective in terminating AF than vernakalant, which increased both APD and APD dispersion. In summary, the initiation and sustenance of rotors in AF is linked to atrial APD heterogeneity and APD reduction due to progressive remodelling. Our results suggest that anti-arrhythmic strategies that increase atrial APD without increasing its dispersion are effective in terminating AF.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Mub7c5LLhLU" width="1" />

            <p>by Dirk Alexander Kulawiak, Brian A. Camley, Wouter-Jan Rappel</p>

In cancer metastasis, embryonic development, and wound healing, cells can coordinate their motion, leading to collective motility. To characterize these cell-cell interactions, which include contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), micropatterned substrates are often used to restrict cell migration to linear, quasi-one-dimensional paths. In these assays, collisions between polarized cells occur frequently with only a few possible outcomes, such as cells reversing direction, sticking to one another, or walking past one another. Using a computational phase field model of collective cell motility that includes the mechanics of cell shape and a minimal chemical model for CIL, we are able to reproduce all cases seen in two-cell collisions. A subtle balance between the internal cell polarization, CIL and cell-cell adhesion governs the collision outcome. We identify the parameters that control transitions between the different cases, including cell-cell adhesion, propulsion strength, and the rates of CIL. These parameters suggest hypotheses for why different cell types have different collision behavior and the effect of interventions that modulate collision outcomes. To reproduce the heterogeneity in cell-cell collision outcomes observed experimentally in neural crest cells, we must either carefully tune our parameters or assume that there is significant cell-to-cell variation in key parameters like cell-cell adhesion.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HoqB3rsZo7o" width="1" />

            Our visual perception of the external world relies on neural activity across a hierarchy of visual cortical areas, communicating via complex feedforward-feedback pathways. While feedforward pathways have been a focus of study, the role of the feedback pathway has remained poorly understood. Here we have developed a novel viral vector combination allowing for selective optogenetic inactivation of feedback pathways in the non-human primate brain. We show that even the most fundamental response properties of visual neurons, such as the receptive field size, are regulated by feedback signals from other regions of the visual cortex. Depending on its activity regime, cortico-cortical feedback can regulate receptive field size and contextual modulation of visual responses or the overall response gain of neurons.

            <p>by Jatin Narula, Abhinav Tiwari, Oleg A. Igoshin</p>

Despite the central role of alternative sigma factors in bacterial stress response and virulence their regulation remains incompletely understood. Here we investigate one of the best-studied examples of alternative sigma factors: the σ<sup>B</sup> network that controls the general stress response of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> to uncover widely relevant general design principles that describe the structure-function relationship of alternative sigma factor regulatory networks. We show that the relative stoichiometry of the synthesis rates of σ<sup>B</sup>, its anti-sigma factor RsbW and the anti-anti-sigma factor RsbV plays a critical role in shaping the network behavior by forcing the σ<sup>B</sup> network to function as an ultrasensitive negative feedback loop. We further demonstrate how this negative feedback regulation insulates alternative sigma factor activity from competition with the housekeeping sigma factor for RNA polymerase and allows multiple stress sigma factors to function simultaneously with little competitive interference.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/272qsJYXiWQ" width="1" />

            <p>by Ricardo Martínez-García, Corina E. Tarnita</p>

Studies of social microbes often focus on one fitness component (reproductive success within the social complex), with little information about or attention to other stages of the life cycle or the ecological context. This can lead to paradoxical results. The life cycle of the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> includes a multicellular stage in which not necessarily clonal amoebae aggregate upon starvation to form a possibly chimeric (genetically heterogeneous) fruiting body made of dead stalk cells and spores. The lab-measured reproductive skew in the spores of chimeras indicates strong social antagonism that should result in low genotypic diversity, which is inconsistent with observations from nature. Two studies have suggested that this inconsistency stems from the one-dimensional assessment of fitness (spore production) and that the solution lies in tradeoffs between multiple life-history traits, e.g.: spore size versus viability; and spore-formation (via aggregation) versus staying vegetative (as non-aggregated cells). We develop an ecologically-grounded, socially-neutral model (i.e. no social interactions between genotypes) for the life cycle of social amoebae in which we theoretically explore multiple non-social life-history traits, tradeoffs and tradeoff-implementing mechanisms. We find that spore production comes at the expense of time to complete aggregation, and, depending on the experimental setup, spore size and viability. Furthermore, experimental results regarding apparent social interactions within chimeric mixes can be qualitatively recapitulated under this neutral hypothesis, without needing to invoke social interactions. This allows for simple potential resolutions to the previously paradoxical results. We conclude that the complexities of life histories, including social behavior and multicellularity, can only be understood in the appropriate multidimensional ecological context, when considering all stages of the life cycle.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a_ozpn-GDCg" width="1" />

            <p>by Matthias Lechner, Mathias Schwarz, Madeleine Opitz, Erwin Frey</p>

Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression plays a crucial role in many bacterial pathways. In particular, the translation of mRNA can be regulated by trans-acting, small, non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) or mRNA-binding proteins, each of which has been successfully treated theoretically using two-component models. An important system that includes a combination of these modes of post-transcriptional regulation is the Colicin E2 system. DNA damage, by triggering the SOS response, leads to the heterogeneous expression of the Colicin E2 operon including the <i>cea</i> gene encoding the toxin colicin E2, and the <i>cel</i> gene that codes for the induction of cell lysis and release of colicin. Although previous studies have uncovered the system’s basic regulatory interactions, its dynamical behavior is still unknown. Here, we develop a simple, yet comprehensive, mathematical model of the colicin E2 regulatory network, and study its dynamics. Its post-transcriptional regulation can be reduced to three hierarchically ordered components: the mRNA including the <i>cel</i> gene, the mRNA-binding protein CsrA, and an effective sRNA that regulates CsrA. We demonstrate that the stationary state of this system exhibits a pronounced threshold in the abundance of free mRNA. As post-transcriptional regulation is known to be noisy, we performed a detailed stochastic analysis, and found fluctuations to be largest at production rates close to the threshold. The magnitude of fluctuations can be tuned by the rate of production of the sRNA. To study the dynamics in response to an SOS signal, we incorporated the LexA-RecA SOS response network into our model. We found that CsrA regulation filtered out short-lived activation peaks and caused a delay in lysis gene expression for prolonged SOS signals, which is also seen in experiments. Moreover, we showed that a stochastic SOS signal creates a broad lysis time distribution. Our model thus theoretically describes Colicin E2 expression dynamics in detail and reveals the importance of the specific regulatory components for the timing of toxin release.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bDjDPkwZa8E" width="1" />

            <p>by Philipp Schwedhelm, B. Suresh Krishna, Stefan Treue</p>

Paying attention to a sensory feature improves its perception and impairs that of others. Recent work has shown that a Normalization Model of Attention (NMoA) can account for a wide range of physiological findings and the influence of different attentional manipulations on visual performance. A key prediction of the NMoA is that attention to a visual feature like an orientation or a motion direction will increase the response of neurons preferring the attended feature (response gain) rather than increase the sensory input strength of the attended stimulus (input gain). This effect of feature-based attention on neuronal responses should translate to similar patterns of improvement in behavioral performance, with psychometric functions showing response gain rather than input gain when attention is directed to the task-relevant feature. In contrast, we report here that when human subjects are cued to attend to one of two motion directions in a transparent motion display, attentional effects manifest as a combination of input and response gain. Further, the impact on input gain is greater when attention is directed towards a narrow range of motion directions than when it is directed towards a broad range. These results are captured by an extended NMoA, which either includes a stimulus-independent attentional contribution to normalization or utilizes direction-tuned normalization. The proposed extensions are consistent with the feature-similarity gain model of attention and the attentional modulation in extrastriate area MT, where neuronal responses are enhanced and suppressed by attention to preferred and non-preferred motion directions respectively.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8DiEzrDG7b4" width="1" />

            <p>by Rahul Subramanian, Andrea L. Graham, Bryan T. Grenfell, Nimalan Arinaminpathy</p>

Despite the availability of vaccines, influenza remains a major public health challenge. A key reason is the virus capacity for immune escape: ongoing evolution allows the continual circulation of seasonal influenza, while novel influenza viruses invade the human population to cause a pandemic every few decades. Current vaccines have to be updated continually to keep up to date with this antigenic change, but emerging ‘universal’ vaccines—targeting more conserved components of the influenza virus—offer the potential to act across all influenza A strains and subtypes. Influenza vaccination programmes around the world are steadily increasing in their population coverage. In future, how might intensive, routine immunization with novel vaccines compare against similar mass programmes utilizing conventional vaccines? Specifically, how might novel and conventional vaccines compare, in terms of cumulative incidence and rates of antigenic evolution of seasonal influenza? What are their potential implications for the impact of pandemic emergence? Here we present a new mathematical model, capturing both transmission dynamics and antigenic evolution of influenza in a simple framework, to explore these questions. We find that, even when matched by per-dose efficacy, universal vaccines could dampen population-level transmission over several seasons to a greater extent than conventional vaccines. Moreover, by lowering opportunities for cross-protective immunity in the population, conventional vaccines could allow the increased spread of a novel pandemic strain. Conversely, universal vaccines could mitigate both seasonal and pandemic spread. However, where it is not possible to maintain annual, intensive vaccination coverage, the duration and breadth of immunity raised by universal vaccines are critical determinants of their performance relative to conventional vaccines. In future, conventional and novel vaccines are likely to play complementary roles in vaccination strategies against influenza: in this context, our results suggest important characteristics to monitor during the clinical development of emerging vaccine technologies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/200hjRib86Q" width="1" />

<div class="para"><p>Recent advances in the understanding of neuropathogenesis associated with Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has led to descriptions of neonatal microcephaly cases. However, none of these reports has evaluated the humoral response during ZIKV infection. We report here polyfunctional immune activation associated with increased IP-10, IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, MCP-1 and G-CSF levels in the amniotic fluid of ZIKV positive pregnant women with neonatal microcephaly. These cytokines have been associated not only with neuronal damage, but also with differentiation and proliferation of neural progenitor cells. Our results suggested that the immune activation caused by ZIKV infection in the uterine environment could also interfere with the fetal development. This article is protected by copyright.

<div class="para"><p>Mitochondrial disorders are amongst the most severe metabolic disorders and are beset by genetic, biochemical, and clinical heterogeneity. Variation between individuals and poor understanding of disease pathophysiology pose significant diagnostic challenges. We present a novel interactive computational network, the Leigh Map, cataloguing &gt;1700 gene-to-phenotype interactions in Leigh syndrome, the most common and genetically heterogeneous mitochondrial disorder. Blinded validation of the Leigh Map yielded an 80% success rate in correct identification of causative genes. We conclude that the Leigh Map is an efficacious resource that, in combination with whole-exome sequencing, can be utilized as a novel diagnostic resource for mitochondrial disease.

<div class="para"><p>Objective.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>There is gathering consensus that altered connectivity is a hallmark of the autistic brain.

It remains unclear if and how connectivity in various neurophysiological frequency ranges develops atypically in autism spectrum disorder.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>To address this in a cross-sectional sample, we recorded resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) from 134 children and adolescents with and without ASD, and calculated resting spectral power and inter-regional synchrony (functional connectivity).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>While no overall group differences were observed, significant alterations in linear and non-linear age-related changes in resting oscillatory power and network synchrony were found. These differences were frequency- and region-specific and implicated brain systems thought to play a prominent role in ASD, such as the frontal cortex and cerebellum. We also found correlations between the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) scores and the degree to which connectivity in cerebellar networks is ‘idiosyncratic' in an individual with autism.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>We provide the first evidence that it is the curvatures of maturational changes in neurophysiological oscillations and synchrony, rather than disturbances in a particular direction, which characterizes the brain function in individuals with ASD. Moreover, the patterns of idiosyncratic distortions of network synchrony relative to the group curve are associated with behavioral symptoms of ASD. This article is protected by copyright.

            <p>Neuropeptides play a key role in the regulation of behaviors and physiological responses including alertness, social recognition, and hunger, yet, their mechanism of action is poorly understood. Here, we focus on the endocrine control ecdysis behavior, which is used by arthropods to shed their cuticle at the end of every molt. Ecdysis is triggered by ETH (Ecdysis triggering hormone), and we show that the response of peptidergic neurons that produce CCAP (crustacean cardioactive peptide), which are key targets of ETH and control the onset of ecdysis behavior, depends fundamentally on the actions of neuropeptides produced by other direct targets of ETH and released in a broad paracrine manner within the CNS; by autocrine influences from the CCAP neurons themselves; and by inhibitory actions mediated by GABA. Our findings provide insights into how this critical insect behavior is controlled and general principles for understanding how neuropeptides organize neuronal activity and behaviors.</p>

            Optogenetics promises spatiotemporal precise control of neural processes using light. However, the spatial extent of illumination within the brain is difficult to control and cannot be adjusted using standard fiber optics. We demonstrate that optical fibers with tapered tips can be used to illuminate either large brain volumes or dynamically selectable subregions. Remotely adjusting the light input angle to the fiber varies the light-emitting portion of the taper over several millimeters without movement of the implant. We use this mode to activate dorsal versus ventral striatum of individual mice and reveal different effects of each manipulation on motor behavior. Conversely injecting light over the full numerical aperture of the fiber results in light emission from the entire taper surface, achieving broader and more efficient optogenetic activation of neurons when compared to the standard flat-faced fiber stimulation. Thus, tapered fibers permit focal or broad illumination that can be precisely and dynamically matched to experimental needs.

            We discuss here what we feel could be an improvement in future discussions of the brain acting as a Bayesian-Laplacian system, by distinguishing between two classes of priors on which the brain's inferential systems operate. In one category are biological priors ({beta} priors) and in the other artefactual ones ( priors). We argue that {beta} priors are inherited or acquired very rapidly after birth and are much more resistant to varying experiences than  priors which, being continuously acquired at various stages throughout post-natal life, are much more accommodating of, and hospitable to, new experiences. Consequently, the posteriors generated from the two sets of priors are likewise different, being more constrained (i.e., precise) for {beta} than for  priors.

            Complex learned behaviors involve the integrated action of distributed brain circuits. While the contributions of individual regions to learning have been extensively investigated, understanding how distributed brain networks orchestrate their activity over the course of learning remains elusive. To address this gap, we used fMRI combined with tools from dynamic network neuroscience to obtain time-resolved descriptions of network coordination during reinforcement learning. We found that reinforcement learning involves dynamic changes in network coupling between the striatum and distributed brain networks. Moreover, we found that the degree of flexibility in whole-brain circuit dynamics correlates with participants learning rate, as derived from reinforcement learning models. Finally, we found that episodic memory, measured in the same participants at the same time, was related to dynamic connectivity in distinct brain networks. These results support the idea that dynamic changes in network communication provide a mechanism for information integration during reinforcement learning.

            <p>by Guillaume Lajoie, Kevin K. Lin, Jean-Philippe Thivierge, Eric Shea-Brown</p>

Highly connected recurrent neural networks often produce chaotic dynamics, meaning their precise activity is sensitive to small perturbations. What are the consequences of chaos for how such networks encode streams of temporal stimuli? On the one hand, chaos is a strong source of randomness, suggesting that small changes in stimuli will be obscured by intrinsically generated variability. On the other hand, recent work shows that the type of chaos that occurs in spiking networks can have a surprisingly low-dimensional structure, suggesting that there may be room for fine stimulus features to be precisely resolved. Here we show that strongly chaotic networks produce patterned spikes that reliably encode time-dependent stimuli: using a decoder sensitive to spike times on timescales of 10’s of ms, one can easily distinguish responses to very similar inputs. Moreover, recurrence serves to distribute signals throughout chaotic networks so that small groups of cells can encode substantial information about signals arriving elsewhere. A conclusion is that the presence of strong chaos in recurrent networks need not exclude precise encoding of temporal stimuli via spike patterns.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i5uNC_Tl8xY" width="1" />

            <p>by Jacob D. Cooper, Benjamin Kerr</p>

Epistatic interactions among genes can give rise to rugged fitness landscapes, in which multiple “peaks” of high-fitness allele combinations are separated by “valleys” of low-fitness genotypes. How populations traverse rugged fitness landscapes is a long-standing question in evolutionary biology. Sexual reproduction may affect how a population moves within a rugged fitness landscape. Sex may generate new high-fitness genotypes by recombination, but it may also destroy high-fitness genotypes by shuffling the genes of a fit parent with a genetically distinct mate, creating low-fitness offspring. Either of these opposing aspects of sex require genotypic diversity in the population. Spatially structured populations may harbor more diversity than well-mixed populations, potentially amplifying both positive and negative effects of sex. On the other hand, spatial structure leads to clumping in which mating is more likely to occur between like types, diminishing the effects of recombination. In this study, we use computer simulations to investigate the combined effects of recombination and spatial structure on adaptation in rugged fitness landscapes. We find that spatially restricted mating and offspring dispersal may allow multiple genotypes inhabiting suboptimal peaks to coexist, and recombination at the “sutures” between the clusters of these genotypes can create genetically novel offspring. Sometimes such an offspring genotype inhabits a new peak on the fitness landscape. In such a case, spatially restricted mating allows this fledgling subpopulation to avoid recombination with distinct genotypes, as mates are more likely to be the same genotype. Such population “centers” can allow nascent peaks to establish despite recombination. Spatial structure may therefore allow an evolving population to enjoy the creative side of sexual recombination while avoiding its destructive side.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/p3-XjTlq4UQ" width="1" />

            <p>by Sang-Hoon Yeo, David W. Franklin, Daniel M. Wolpert</p>

Movement planning is thought to be primarily determined by motor costs such as inaccuracy and effort. Solving for the optimal plan that minimizes these costs typically leads to specifying a time-varying feedback controller which both generates the movement and can optimally correct for errors that arise within a movement. However, the quality of the sensory feedback during a movement can depend substantially on the generated movement. We show that by incorporating such state-dependent sensory feedback, the optimal solution incorporates active sensing and is no longer a pure feedback process but includes a significant feedforward component. To examine whether people take into account such state-dependency in sensory feedback we asked people to make movements in which we controlled the reliability of sensory feedback. We made the visibility of the hand state-dependent, such that the visibility was proportional to the component of hand velocity in a particular direction. Subjects gradually adapted to such a sensory perturbation by making curved hand movements. In particular, they appeared to control the late visibility of the movement matching predictions of the optimal controller with state-dependent sensory noise. Our results show that trajectory planning is not only sensitive to motor costs but takes sensory costs into account and argues for optimal control of movement in which feedforward commands can play a significant role.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8lzutRw9jOw" width="1" />

            <p>Visual cognition is thought to rely heavily on contextual expectations. Accordingly, previous studies have revealed distinct neural signatures for expected versus unexpected stimuli in visual cortex. However, it is presently unknown how the brain combines multiple concurrent stimulus expectations such as those we have for different features of a familiar object. To understand how an unexpected object feature affects the simultaneous processing of other expected feature(s), we combined human fMRI with a task that independently manipulated expectations for color and motion features of moving-dot stimuli. Behavioral data and neural signals from visual cortex were then interrogated to adjudicate between three possible ways in which prediction error (surprise) in the processing of one feature might affect the concurrent processing of another, expected feature: (1) feature processing may be independent; (2) surprise might "spread" from the unexpected to the expected feature, rendering the entire object unexpected; or (3) pairing a surprising feature with an expected feature might promote the inference that the two features are not in fact part of the same object. To formalize these rival hypotheses, we implemented them in a simple computational model of multifeature expectations. Across a range of analyses, behavior and visual neural signals consistently supported a model that assumes a mixing of prediction error signals across features: surprise in one object feature spreads to its other feature(s), thus rendering the entire object unexpected. These results reveal neurocomputational principles of multifeature expectations and indicate that objects are the unit of selection for predictive vision.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We address a key question in predictive visual cognition: how does the brain combine multiple concurrent expectations for different features of a single object such as its color and motion trajectory? By combining a behavioral protocol that independently varies expectation of (and attention to) multiple object features with computational modeling and fMRI, we demonstrate that behavior and fMRI activity patterns in visual cortex are best accounted for by a model in which prediction error in one object feature spreads to other object features. These results demonstrate how predictive vision forms object-level expectations out of multiple independent features.</p>

            <p>While early cortical visual areas contain fine scale spatial organization of neuronal properties, such as orientation preference, the spatial organization of higher-level visual areas is less well understood. The fMRI demonstration of face-preferring regions in human ventral cortex and monkey inferior temporal cortex ("face patches") raises the question of how neural selectivity for faces is organized. Here, we targeted hundreds of spatially registered neural recordings to the largest fMRI-identified face-preferring region in monkeys, the middle face patch (MFP), and show that the MFP contains a graded enrichment of face-preferring neurons. At its center, as much as 93% of the sites we sampled responded twice as strongly to faces than to nonface objects. We estimate the maximum neurophysiological size of the MFP to be ~6 mm in diameter, consistent with its previously reported size under fMRI. Importantly, face selectivity in the MFP varied strongly even between neighboring sites. Additionally, extremely face-selective sites were ~40 times more likely to be present inside the MFP than outside. These results provide the first direct quantification of the size and neural composition of the MFP by showing that the cortical tissue localized to the fMRI defined region consists of a very high fraction of face-preferring sites near its center, and a monotonic decrease in that fraction along any radial spatial axis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The underlying organization of neurons that give rise to the large spatial regions of activity observed with fMRI is not well understood. Neurophysiological studies that have targeted the fMRI identified face patches in monkeys have provided evidence for both large-scale clustering and a heterogeneous spatial organization. Here we used a novel x-ray imaging system to spatially map the responses of hundreds of sites in and around the middle face patch. We observed that face-selective signal localized to the middle face patch was characterized by a gradual spatial enrichment. Furthermore, strongly face-selective sites were ~40 times more likely to be found inside the patch than outside of the patch.</p>

            <p>The midposterior fundus of the Sylvian fissure in the human brain is central to the cortical processing of vestibular cues. At least two vestibular areas are located at this site: the parietoinsular vestibular cortex (PIVC) and the posterior insular cortex (PIC). It is now well established that activity in sensory systems is subject to cross-modal attention effects. Attending to a stimulus in one sensory modality enhances activity in the corresponding cortical sensory system, but simultaneously suppresses activity in other sensory systems. Here, we wanted to probe whether such cross-modal attention effects also target the vestibular system. To this end, we used a visual multiple-object tracking task. By parametrically varying the number of tracked targets, we could measure the effect of attentional load on the PIVC and the PIC while holding the perceptual load constant. Participants performed the tracking task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results show that, compared with passive viewing of object motion, activity during object tracking was suppressed in the PIVC and enhanced in the PIC. Greater attentional load, induced by increasing the number of tracked targets, was associated with a corresponding increase in the suppression of activity in the PIVC. Activity in the anterior part of the PIC decreased with increasing load, whereas load effects were absent in the posterior PIC. Results of a control experiment show that attention-induced suppression in the PIVC is stronger than any suppression evoked by the visual stimulus per se. Overall, our results suggest that attention has a cross-modal modulatory effect on the vestibular cortex during visual object tracking.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this study we investigate cross-modal attention effects in the human vestibular cortex. We applied the visual multiple-object tracking task because it is known to evoke attentional load effects on neural activity in visual motion-processing and attention-processing areas. Here we demonstrate a load-dependent effect of attention on the activation in the vestibular cortex, despite constant visual motion stimulation. We find that activity in the parietoinsular vestibular cortex is more strongly suppressed the greater the attentional load on the visual tracking task. These findings suggest cross-modal attentional modulation in the vestibular cortex.</p>

            <p>The dorsal and ventral periaqueductal gray (dPAG and vPAG, respectively) are embedded in distinct survival networks that coordinate, respectively, innate and conditioned fear-evoked freezing. However, the information encoded by the PAG during these survival behaviors is poorly understood. Recordings in the dPAG and vPAG in rats revealed differences in neuronal activity associated with the two behaviors. During innate fear, neuronal responses were significantly greater in the dPAG compared with the vPAG. After associative fear conditioning and during early extinction (EE), when freezing was maximal, a field potential was evoked in the PAG by the auditory fear conditioned stimulus (CS). With repeated presentations of the unreinforced CS, animals displayed progressively less freezing accompanied by a reduction in event-related field potential amplitude. During EE, the majority of dPAG and vPAG units increased their firing frequency, but spike-triggered averaging showed that only ventral activity during the presentation of the CS was significantly coupled to EMG-related freezing behavior. This PAG–EMG coupling was only present for the onset of freezing activity during the CS in EE. During late extinction, a subpopulation of units in the dPAG and vPAG continued to show CS-evoked responses; that is, they were extinction resistant. Overall, these findings support roles for the dPAG in innate and conditioned fear and for the vPAG in initiating but not maintaining the drive to muscles to generate conditioned freezing. The existence of extinction-susceptible and extinction-resistant cells also suggests that the PAG plays a role in encoding fear memories.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The periaqueductal gray (PAG) orchestrates survival behaviors, with the dorsal (dPAG) and ventral (vPAG) PAG concerned respectively with innate and learnt fear responses. We recorded neural activity from dPAG and vPAG in rats during the expression of innate fear and extinction of learned freezing. Cells in dPAG responded more robustly during innate fear, but dPAG and vPAG both encoded the time of the conditioned stimulus during early extinction and displayed extinction sensitive and resistant characteristics. Only vPAG discharge was correlated with muscle activity, but this was limited to the onset of conditioned freezing. The data suggest that the roles of dPAG and vPAG in fear behavior are more complex than previously thought, including a potential role in fear memory.</p>

            <p>The establishment of precise topographic maps during neural development is facilitated by the presorting of axons in the pathway before they reach their targets. In the vertebrate visual system, such topography is seen clearly in the optic tract (OT) and in the optic radiations. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in pretarget axon sorting are poorly understood. Here, we show in zebrafish that the RNA-binding protein Hermes, which is expressed exclusively in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), is involved in this process. Using a RiboTag approach, we show that Hermes acts as a negative translational regulator of specific mRNAs in RGCs. One of these targets is the guidance cue receptor Neuropilin 1 (Nrp1), which is sensitive to the repellent cue Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A). Hermes knock-down leads to topographic missorting in the OT through the upregulation of Nrp1. Restoring Nrp1 to appropriate levels in Hermes-depleted embryos rescues this effect and corrects the axon-sorting defect in the OT. Our data indicate that axon sorting relies on Hermes-regulated translation of Nrp1.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> An important mechanism governing the formation of the mature neural map is pretarget axon sorting within the sensory tract; however, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process remain largely unknown. The work presented here reveals a novel function for the RNA-binding protein Hermes in regulating the topographic sorting of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons in the optic tract and tectum. We find that Hermes negatively controls the translation of the guidance cue receptor Neuropilin-1 in RGCs, with Hermes knock-down resulting in aberrant growth cone cue sensitivity and axonal topographic misprojections. We characterize a novel RNA-based mechanism by which axons restrict their translatome developmentally to achieve proper targeting.</p>

            <p>A hallmark of cognitive control is the ability to rein in impulsive responses. Previously, we used a Bayesian model to describe trial-by-trial likelihood of the stop signal or p(Stop) and related regional activations to p(Stop) to response slowing in a stop signal task. Here, we characterized the regional processes of conflict anticipation in association with intersubject variation in impulse control in 114 young adults. We computed the stop signal reaction time (SSRT) and a measure of motor urgency, indexed by the reaction time (RT) difference between go and stop error trials or "GoRT – SERT," where GoRT is the go trial RT and SERT is the stop error RT. Motor urgency and SSRT were positively correlated across subjects. A linear regression identified regional activations to p(Stop), each in correlation with SSRT and motor urgency. We hypothesized that shared neural activities mediate the correlation between motor urgency and SSRT in proactive control of impulsivity. Activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) during conflict anticipation correlated negatively with the SSRT. Activation of the right SFG also correlated negatively with GoRT – SERT. Therefore, activation of the right SFG was associated with more efficient response inhibition and less motor urgency. A mediation analysis showed that right SFG activation to conflict anticipation mediates the correlation between SSRT and motor urgency bidirectionally. The current results highlight a specific role of the right SFG in translating conflict anticipation to the control of impulsive response, which is consistent with earlier studies suggesting its function in action restraint.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Individuals vary in impulse control. However, the neural bases underlying individual variation in proactive control of impulsive responses remain unknown. Here, in a large sample of young adults, we showed that activation of the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) during conflict anticipation is positively correlated with the capacity of inhibitory control and negatively with motor urgency in the stop signal task. Importantly, activity of the right SFG mediates the counteracting processes of inhibitory control and motor urgency across subjects. The results support a unique role of the right SFG in individual variation in cognitive control.</p>

            <p>The hippocampus is thought to compare predicted events with current perceptual input, generating a mismatch signal when predictions are violated. However, most prior studies have only inferred when predictions occur without measuring them directly. Moreover, an important but unresolved question is whether hippocampal mismatch signals are modulated by the degree to which predictions differ from outcomes. Here, we conducted a human fMRI study in which subjects repeatedly studied various word–picture pairs, learning to predict particular pictures (outcomes) from the words (cues). After initial learning, a subset of cues was paired with a novel, unexpected outcome, whereas other cues continued to predict the same outcome. Critically, when outcomes changed, the new outcome was either "near" to the predicted outcome (same visual category as the predicted picture) or "far" from the predicted outcome (different visual category). Using multivoxel pattern analysis, we indexed cue-evoked reactivation (prediction) within neocortical areas and related these trial-by-trial measures of prediction strength to univariate hippocampal responses to the outcomes. We found that prediction strength positively modulated hippocampal responses to unexpected outcomes, particularly when unexpected outcomes were close, but not identical, to the prediction. Hippocampal responses to unexpected outcomes were also associated with a tradeoff in performance during a subsequent memory test: relatively faster retrieval of new (updated) associations, but relatively slower retrieval of the original (older) associations. Together, these results indicate that hippocampal mismatch signals reflect a comparison between active predictions and current outcomes and that these signals are most robust when predictions are similar, but not identical, to outcomes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although the hippocampus is widely thought to signal "mismatches" between memory-based predictions and outcomes, previous research has not linked hippocampal mismatch signals directly to neural measures of prediction strength. Here, we show that hippocampal mismatch signals increase as a function of the strength of predictions in neocortical regions. This increase in hippocampal mismatch signals was particularly robust when outcomes were similar, but not identical, to predictions. These results indicate that hippocampal mismatch signals are driven by both the active generation of predictions and the similarity between predictions and outcomes.</p>

            <p>Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2 (CPEB2) is an RNA-binding protein and translational regulator. To understand the physiological function of CPEB2, we generated CPEB2 knock-out (KO) mice and found that most died within 3 d after birth. CPEB2 is highly expressed in the brainstem, which controls vital functions, such as breathing. Whole-body plethysmography revealed that KO neonates had aberrant respiration with frequent apnea. Nevertheless, the morphology and function of the respiratory rhythm generator and diaphragm neuromuscular junctions appeared normal. We found that upregulated translation of choline acetyltransferase in the CPEB2 KO dorsal motor nucleus of vagus resulted in hyperactivation of parasympathetic signaling-induced bronchoconstriction, as evidenced by increased pulmonary acetylcholine and phosphorylated myosin light chain 2 in bronchial smooth muscles. Specific deletion of CPEB2 in cholinergic neurons sufficiently caused increased apnea in neonatal pups and airway hyper-reactivity in adult mice. Moreover, inhalation of an anticholinergic bronchodilator reduced apnea episodes in global and cholinergic CPEB2-KO mice. Together, the elevated airway constriction induced by cholinergic transmission in KO neonates may account for the respiratory defect and mortality.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study first generated and characterized <i>cpeb2</i> gene-deficient mice. CPEB2-knock-out (KO) mice are born alive but most die within 3 d after birth showing no overt defects in anatomy. We found that the KO neonates showed severe apnea and altered respiratory pattern. Such respiratory defects could be recapitulated in mice with pan-neuron-specific or cholinergic neuron-specific ablation of the <i>cpeb2</i> gene. Further investigation revealed that cholinergic transmission in the KO dorsal motor nucleus of vagus was overactivated because KO mice lack CPEB2-suppressed translation of the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of acetylcholine (i.e., choline acetyltransferase). Consequently, increased parasympathetic signaling leads to hyperactivated bronchoconstriction and abnormal respiration in the KO neonates.</p>

            <p>Goal-directed and instrumental learning are both important controllers of human behavior. Learning about which stimulus event occurs in the environment and the reward associated with them allows humans to seek out the most valuable stimulus and move through the environment in a goal-directed manner. Stimulus–response associations are characteristic of instrumental learning, whereas response–outcome associations are the hallmark of goal-directed learning. Here we provide behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging results from a novel task in which stimulus–response and response–outcome associations are learned simultaneously but dominate behavior at different stages of the experiment. We found that prediction error representations in the ventral striatum depend on which type of learning dominates. Furthermore, the amygdala tracks the time-dependent weighting of stimulus–response versus response–outcome learning. Our findings suggest that the goal-directed and instrumental controllers dynamically engage the ventral striatum in representing prediction errors whenever one of them is dominating choice behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Converging evidence in human neuroimaging studies has shown that the reward prediction errors are correlated with activity in the ventral striatum. Our results demonstrate that this region is simultaneously correlated with a stimulus prediction error. Furthermore, the learning system that is currently dominating behavioral choice dynamically engages the ventral striatum for computing its prediction errors. This demonstrates that the prediction error representations are highly dynamic and influenced by various experimental context. This finding points to a general role of the ventral striatum in detecting expectancy violations and encoding error signals regardless of the specific nature of the reinforcer itself.</p>

            <p>HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) affects approximately half of HIV-infected patients. Infected non-neuronal cells release neurotoxic factors such as the viral protein transactivator of transcription (Tat) that potentiate NMDAR function. NMDARs regulate synaptic changes observed after exposure to HIV proteins, which may underlie cognitive impairment in HAND patients. Here, we used patch-clamp recording to measure NMDAR-mediated currents in rat hippocampal cultures after exposure to Tat. Tat (4–16 h) potentiated NMDA-evoked whole-cell current and increased the NMDAR:AMPAR ratio of evoked EPSCs. Potentiated currents adapted back to baseline amplitudes after 24 h of exposure to Tat. Pharmacological inhibition of GluN2A-containing NMDARs prevented adaptation, but inhibition of GluN2B-containing NMDARs did not. Pharmacological and genetic approaches determined that potentiated NMDARs activated the kinase Akt, which then activated the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2. Inhibition of protein synthesis prevented adaptation, suggesting that Mdm2 altered gene expression, possibly through its well known target p53. Expression of GFP-tagged GluN1 subunits resulted in fluorescent puncta that colocalized with synaptic markers. Tat (24 h) caused an Mdm2-dependent loss of NMDAR puncta on a timescale similar to adaption of NMDAR function. Activation of the Mdm2 pathway degrades PSD-95, a scaffolding protein that clusters NMDARs at the synapse and enhances their function. Adaptation to the continued presence of excitotoxins that potentiate NMDARs such as HIV Tat may protect from excessive NMDAR activation while also contributing to the synaptic loss that correlates with cognitive decline in HAND.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Synaptodendritic damage correlates with cognitive decline in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). In a cell culture model, we show that the HIV protein transactivator of transcription (Tat) initially potentiates NMDARs that then adapt to the presence of the toxin. Adaptation of NMDAR function was mediated by a GluN2A/Akt/Mdm2 pathway not previously linked to neuroinflammatory disorders such as HAND. Activation of this pathway caused a loss of synaptic NMDAR clusters. Decreased NMDAR function may result from a homeostatic response gone awry and underlie impaired synaptic function in HAND.</p>

            <p>Continuous cerebral blood flow is essential for neuronal survival, but whether vascular tone influences resting neuronal function is not known. Using a multidisciplinary approach in both rat and mice brain slices, we determined whether flow/pressure-evoked increases or decreases in parenchymal arteriole vascular tone, which result in arteriole constriction and dilation, respectively, altered resting cortical pyramidal neuron activity. We present evidence for intercellular communication in the brain involving a flow of information from vessel to astrocyte to neuron, a direction opposite to that of classic neurovascular coupling and referred to here as vasculo-neuronal coupling (VNC). Flow/pressure increases within parenchymal arterioles increased vascular tone and simultaneously decreased resting pyramidal neuron firing activity. On the other hand, flow/pressure decreases evoke parenchymal arteriole dilation and increased resting pyramidal neuron firing activity. In <i>GLAST-CreERT2</i>; <i>R26-lsl-GCaMP3</i> mice, we demonstrate that increased parenchymal arteriole tone significantly increased intracellular calcium in perivascular astrocyte processes, the onset of astrocyte calcium changes preceded the inhibition of cortical pyramidal neuronal firing activity. During increases in parenchymal arteriole tone, the pyramidal neuron response was unaffected by blockers of nitric oxide, GABA<sub>A</sub>, glutamate, or ecto-ATPase. However, VNC was abrogated by TRPV4 channel, GABA<sub>B</sub>, as well as an adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor blocker. Differently to pyramidal neuron responses, increases in flow/pressure within parenchymal arterioles increased the firing activity of a subtype of interneuron. Together, these data suggest that VNC is a complex constitutive active process that enables neurons to efficiently adjust their resting activity according to brain perfusion levels, thus safeguarding cellular homeostasis by preventing mismatches between energy supply and demand.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We present evidence for vessel-to-neuron communication in the brain slice defined here as vasculo-neuronal coupling. We showed that, in response to increases in parenchymal arteriole tone, astrocyte intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increased and cortical neuronal activity decreased. On the other hand, decreasing parenchymal arteriole tone increased resting cortical pyramidal neuron activity. Vasculo-neuronal coupling was partly mediated by TRPV4 channels as genetic ablation, or pharmacological blockade impaired increased flow/pressure-evoked neuronal inhibition. Increased flow/pressure-evoked neuronal inhibition was blocked in the presence of adenosine A1 receptor and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor blockade.

            <p>PPAR is one of the three isoforms of the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs). PPAR is activated by thiazolidinediones such as pioglitazone and is targeted to treat insulin resistance. PPAR is densely expressed in brain areas involved in regulation of motivational and emotional processes. Here, we investigated the role of PPAR in the brain and explored its role in anxiety and stress responses in mice. The results show that stimulation of PPAR by pioglitazone did not affect basal anxiety, but fully prevented the anxiogenic effect of acute stress. Using mice with genetic ablation of neuronal PPAR (PPAR<sup>NestinCre</sup>), we demonstrated that a lack of receptors, specifically in neurons, exacerbated basal anxiety and enhanced stress sensitivity. The administration of GW9662, a selective PPAR antagonist, elicited a marked anxiogenic response in PPAR wild-type (WT), but not in PPAR<sup>NestinCre</sup> knock-out (KO) mice. Using c-Fos immunohistochemistry, we observed that acute stress exposure resulted in a different pattern of neuronal activation in the amygdala (AMY) and the hippocampus (HIPP) of PPAR<sup>NestinCre</sup> KO mice compared with WT mice. No differences were found between WT and KO mice in hypothalamic regions responsible for hormonal response to stress or in blood corticosterone levels. Microinjection of pioglitazone into the AMY, but not into the HIPP, abolished the anxiogenic response elicited by acute stress. Results also showed that, in both regions, PPAR colocalizes with GABAergic cells. These findings demonstrate that neuronal PPAR is involved the regulation of the stress response and that the AMY is a key substrate for the anxiolytic effect of PPAR.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPAR) is a classical target for antidiabetic therapies with thiazolidinedione compounds. PPAR agonists such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are in clinical use for the treatment of insulin resistance. PPAR has recently attracted attention for its involvement in the regulation of CNS immune response and functions. Here, we demonstrate that neuronal PPAR activation prevented the negative emotional effects of stress and exerted anxiolytic actions without influencing hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis function. Conversely, pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of PPAR enhanced anxiogenic responses and increased vulnerability to stress. These effects appear to be controlled by PPAR neuronal-mediated mechanisms in the amygdala.</p>

Although dysfunctional apical cilia in the ependymal cell layer are causal to the onset of hydrocephalus, mechanisms underlying proper ependymal cell differentiation are largely unclear. SNX27 is a trafficking component required for normal brain function and was shown previously to suppress -secretase-dependent amyloid precursor protein and Notch cleavage. However, it was unclear how SNX27-dependent -secretase inhibition could contribute to brain development and pathophysiology. Here, we describe and characterize an <i>Snx27</i>-deleted mouse model for the ependymal layer defects of deciliation and hydrocephalus. SNX27 deficiency results in reductions in ependymal cells and cilia density, as well as severe postnatal hydrocephalus. Inhibition of Notch intracellular domain signaling with -secretase inhibitors reversed ependymal cells/cilia loss and dilation of lateral ventricles in <i>Snx27</i>-deficient mice, giving strong indication that <i>Snx27</i> deletion triggers defects in ependymal layer formation and ciliogenesis through Notch hyperactivation. Together, these results suggest that SNX27 is essential for ependymal cell differentiation and ciliogenesis, and its deletion can promote hydrocephalus pathogenesis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Down's syndrome (DS) in humans and mouse models has been shown previously to confer a high risk for the development of pathological hydrocephalus. Because we have previously described SNX27 as a component that is consistently downregulated in DS, we present here a robust <i>Snx27</i>-deleted mouse model that produces hydrocephalus and associated ciliary defects with complete penetrance. In addition, we find that -secretase/Notch modulation may be a candidate drug target in SNX27-associated hydrocephalus such as that observed in DS. Based on these findings, we anticipate that future study will determine whether modulation of a SNX27/Notch/-secretase pathway can also be of therapeutic interest to congenital hydrocephalus.</p>

            <p>Atypical multisensory integration is an understudied cognitive symptom in schizophrenia. Procedures to evaluate multisensory integration in rodent models are lacking. We developed a novel multisensory object oddity (MSO) task to assess multisensory integration in ketamine-treated rats, a well established model of schizophrenia. Ketamine-treated rats displayed a selective MSO task impairment with tactile–visual and olfactory–visual sensory combinations, whereas basic unisensory perception was unaffected. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) administration of nicotine or ABT-418, an α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>2</sub> nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist, normalized MSO task performance in ketamine-treated rats and this effect was blocked by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonism. GABAergic currents were also decreased in OFC of ketamine-treated rats and were normalized by activation of α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>2</sub> nAChRs. Furthermore, parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactivity was decreased in the OFC of ketamine-treated rats. Accordingly, silencing of PV interneurons in OFC of PV-Cre mice using DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) selectively impaired MSO task performance and this was reversed by ABT-418. Likewise, clozapine-<i>N</i>-oxide-induced inhibition of PV interneurons in brain slices was reversed by activation of α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>2</sub> nAChRs. These findings strongly imply a role for prefrontal GABAergic transmission in the integration of multisensory object features, a cognitive process with relevance to schizophrenia. Accordingly, nAChR agonism, which improves various facets of cognition in schizophrenia, reversed the severe MSO task impairment in this study and appears to do so via a GABAergic mechanism. Interactions between GABAergic and nAChR receptor systems warrant further investigation for potential therapeutic applications. The novel behavioral procedure introduced in the current study is acutely sensitive to schizophrenia-relevant cognitive impairment and should prove highly valuable for such research.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Adaptive behaviors are driven by integration of information from different sensory modalities. Multisensory integration is disrupted in patients with schizophrenia, but little is known about the neural basis of this cognitive symptom. Development and validation of multisensory integration tasks for animal models is essential given the strong link between functional outcome and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. We present a novel multisensory object oddity procedure that detects selective multisensory integration deficits in a rat model of schizophrenia using various combinations of sensory modalities. Moreover, converging data are consistent with a nicotinic-GABAergic mechanism of multisensory integration in the prefrontal cortex, results with strong clinical relevance to the study of cognitive impairment and treatment in schizophrenia.</p>

            <p>Aging is accompanied by profound changes in the brain's dopamine system that affect cognitive function. Evidence of powerful individual differences in cognitive aging has sharpened focus on identifying biological factors underlying relative preservation versus vulnerability to decline. Dopamine represents a key target in these efforts. Alterations of dopamine receptors and dopamine synthesis are seen in aging, with receptors generally showing reduction and synthesis demonstrating increases. Using the PET tracer 6-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-l-<i>m</i>-tyrosine, we found strong support for upregulated striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in healthy older adult humans free of amyloid pathology, relative to young people. We next used fMRI to define the functional impact of elevated synthesis capacity on cognitive flexibility, a core component of executive function. We found clear evidence in young adults that low levels of synthesis capacity were suboptimal, associated with diminished cognitive flexibility and altered frontoparietal activation relative to young adults with highest synthesis values. Critically, these relationships between dopamine, performance, and activation were transformed in older adults with higher synthesis capacity. Variability in synthesis capacity was related to intrinsic frontoparietal functional connectivity across groups, suggesting that striatal dopamine synthesis influences the tuning of networks underlying cognitive flexibility. Together, these findings define striatal dopamine's association with cognitive flexibility and its neural underpinnings in young adults, and reveal the alteration in dopamine-related neural processes in aging.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Few studies have combined measurement of brain dopamine with examination of the neural basis of cognition in youth and aging to delineate the underlying mechanisms of these associations. Combining <i>in vivo</i> PET imaging of dopamine synthesis capacity, fMRI, and a sensitive measure of cognitive flexibility, we reveal three core findings. First, we find evidence supporting older adults' capacity to upregulate dopamine synthesis. Second, we define relationships between dopamine, cognition, and frontoparietal activity in young adults indicating high levels of synthesis capacity are optimal. Third, we demonstrate alteration of these relationships in older adults, suggesting neurochemical modulation of cognitive flexibility changes with age.</p>

            <p>Calcium homeostasis plays a major role in maintaining neuronal function under physiological conditions. Amyloid-β (Aβ) initiates pathological processes that include disruption in intracellular calcium levels, so amelioration of the calcium alteration could serve as an indirect functional indicator of treatment efficacy. Therefore, calcium dynamics were used as a measure of functional outcome. We evaluated the effects of the anti-Aβ antibody aducanumab on calcium homeostasis and plaque clearance in aged Tg2576 mice with <i>in vivo</i> multiphoton imaging. Acute topical application of aducanumab to the brain resulted in clearance of amyloid plaques. Although chronic systemic administration of aducanumab in 22-month-old mice did not clear existing plaques, calcium overload was ameliorated over time. Therefore, this antibody likely restores neuronal network function that possibly underlies cognitive deficits, indicating promise as a clinical treatment. In addition, functional readouts such as calcium overload may be a more useful outcome measure to monitor treatment efficacy in models of Alzheimer's disease compared with amyloid burden alone.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is currently without a cure. Aducanumab is an anti-amyloid-β antibody being developed for the treatment of AD. Interim analyses of a phase 1b clinical trial have suggested potential beneficial effects on amyloid pathology and cognitive status in patients treated with aducanumab (Sevigny et al., 2016). Here, we show that a murine analog of aducanumab clears amyloid plaques in an acute setting and restores calcium homeostasis disrupted in a mouse model of AD upon chronic treatment. Therefore, we demonstrate that aducanumab reverses a functional outcome measure reflective of neural network activity.</p>

            <p>Working memory, the ability to temporarily maintain representational knowledge, is a foundational cognitive process that can become compromised in aging and neuropsychiatric disease. NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation in prefrontal cortex (PFC) is necessary for the pyramidal neuron activity believed to enable working memory; however, the distinct biophysical properties and localization of NMDARs containing NR2A and NR2B subunits suggest unique roles for NMDAR subtypes in PFC neural activity and working memory. Experiments herein show that working memory depends on NR2A- but not NR2B-NMDARs in PFC of rats and that NR2A-NMDARs mediate the majority of evoked NMDAR currents on layer 2/3 PFC pyramidal neurons. Moreover, attenuated expression of the NR2A but not the NR2B subunit in PFC associates with naturally occurring working memory impairment in aged rats. Finally, NMDAR currents and working memory are enhanced in aged rats by promoting activation of the NR2A-enriched synaptic pool of PFC NMDARs. These results implicate NR2A-NMDARs in normal working memory and suggest novel treatment strategies for improving working memory in cognitive disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Working memory, the ability to hold information "in mind," requires persistent activity of pyramidal neurons in prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediated by NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation. NMDAR loss in PFC may account for working memory impairments in aging and psychiatric disease. Our studies demonstrate that NMDARs containing the NR2A subunit, but not the NR2B subunit, are required for working memory and that loss of NR2A predicts severity of age-related working memory impairment. The importance of NR2A to working memory is likely due its abundant contribution to pyramidal neuron activity and location at synaptic sites in PFC. This information is useful in designing new therapies to treat working memory impairments by enhancing the function of NR2A-containing NMDARs.</p>

            <p>Conflict adaptation is a hallmark effect of adaptive cognitive control and refers to the adjustment of control to the level of previously experienced conflict. Conflict monitoring theory assumes that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is causally involved in this adjustment. However, to date, evidence in humans is predominantly correlational, and heterogeneous with respect to the lateralization of control in the DLPFC. We used high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS), which allows for more focal current delivery than conventional tDCS, to clarify the causal involvement of the DLPFC in conflict adaptation. Specifically, we investigated the regional specificity and lateralization of potential beneficial stimulation effects on conflict adaptation during a visual flanker task. One hundred twenty healthy participants were assigned to four HD-tDCS conditions: left or right DLPFC or left or right primary motor cortex (M1). Each group underwent both active and sham HD-tDCS in crossover, double-blind designs. We obtained a sizeable conflict adaptation effect (measured as the modulation of the flanker effect as a function of previous response conflict) in all groups and conditions. However, this effect was larger under active HD-tDCS than under sham stimulation in both DLPFC groups. In contrast, active stimulation had no effect on conflict adaptation in the M1 groups. In sum, the present results indicate that the DLPFC plays a causal role in adaptive cognitive control, but that the involvement of DLPFC in control is not restricted to the left or right hemisphere. Moreover, our study confirms the potential of HD-tDCS to modulate cognition in a regionally specific manner.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Conflict adaptation is a hallmark effect of adaptive cognitive control. While animal studies have suggested causal involvement of the DLPFC in this phenomenon, such evidence is currently lacking in humans. The present study used high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) to demonstrate that the DLPFC is causally involved in conflict adaptation in humans. Our study confirms a central claim of conflict monitoring theory, which up to now has predominantly relied on correlational studies. Our results further indicate an equal involvement of the left and right DLPFC in adaptive control, whereas stimulation of a control region—the primary motor cortex—had no effect on adaptive control. The study thus confirms the potential of HD-tDCS to modulate cognition in a regionally specific manner.</p>

            <p>Human height variation is determined by genetic and environmental factors, but it remains unclear whether their influences differ across birth-year cohorts. We conducted an individual-based pooled analysis of 40 twin cohorts including 143,390 complete twin pairs born 1886–1994. Although genetic variance showed a generally increasing trend across the birth-year cohorts, heritability estimates (0.69-0.84 in men and 0.53-0.78 in women) did not present any clear pattern of secular changes. Comparing geographic-cultural regions (Europe, North America and Australia, and East Asia), total height variance was greatest in North America and Australia and lowest in East Asia, but no clear pattern in the heritability estimates across the birth-year cohorts emerged. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that heritability of height is lower in populations with low living standards than in affluent populations, nor that heritability of height will increase within a population as living standards improve.</p>

Here, we report hominin tracks unearthed in the new Site S at Laetoli and referred to two bipedal individuals (S1 and S2) moving on the same palaeosurface and in the same direction as the three hominins documented at Site G. The stature estimates for S1 greatly exceed those previously reconstructed for <em>Au. afarensis</em> from both skeletal material and footprint data. In combination with a comparative reappraisal of the Site G footprints, the evidence collected here embodies very important additions to the Pliocene record of hominin behaviour and morphology. Our results are consistent with considerable body size variation and, probably, degree of sexual dimorphism within a single species of bipedal hominins as early as 3.66 million years ago.</p>

            Variability and correlations in cortical activity are ubiquitously modulated by stimuli. Correlated variability is quenched following stimulus onset across multiple cortical areas, suppressing low-frequency components of the LFP and of Vm-LFP coherence. Modulation of Fano factors and correlations in area MT is tuned for stimulus direction. What circuit mechanisms underly these behaviors? We show that a simple model circuit, the stochastic Stabilized Supralinear Network (SSN), robustly explains these results. Stimuli modulate variability by modifying two forms of effective connectivity between activity patterns that characterize excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) circuits. Increases in the strength with which activity patterns inhibit themselves reduce correlated variability, while increases in feedforward connections between patterns (transforming E/I imbalance into balanced fluctuations) increase variability. These results suggest an operating regime of cortical dynamics that involves fast fluctuations and fast responses to stimulus changes, unlike previous models of variability suppression through suppression of chaos or networks with multiple attractors.

            Perceptual decisions require the transformation of raw sensory inputs into cortical representations suitable for stimulus discrimination. One of the best-known examples of this transformation involves the middle temporal area (MT) of the primate visual cortex. Area MT provides a robust representation of stimulus motion, and previous work has shown that it contributes causally to performance on motion discrimination tasks. Here we report that the strength of this contribution can be highly plastic: Depending on the recent training history, pharmacological inactivation of MT can severely impair motion discrimination, or it can have no effect whatsoever. Similarly, depending on training, microstimulation can bias motion perception or simply introduce noise. Further analysis of neural and behavioral data suggests that training shifts the readout of motion information flexibly between MT and lower-level cortical areas. These results show that the contribution of individual brain regions to conscious perception can be dramatically altered by sensory experience.

            Experimental methods in neuroscience, such as calcium-imaging and recordings with multielectrode arrays, are advancing at a rapid pace. They produce insight into the simultaneous activity of large numbers of neurons, and into plasticity processes in the brains of awake and behaving animals. These new data constrain models for neural computation and network plasticity that underlie perception, cognition, behavior, and learning. I will discuss in this short article four such constraints: Inherent recurrent network activity and heterogeneous dynamic properties of neurons and synapses, stereotypical spatio-temporal activity patterns in networks of neurons, high trial-to-trial variability of network responses, and functional stability in spite of permanently ongoing changes in the network. I am proposing that these constraints provide hints to underlying principles of brain computation and learning.

            A network analysis of the resting state (RS) and language task (LT) of fRMI data sets is presented. Specifically, the analysis compares the impact of the global signal regression of gray matter signal on the graph parameters and community structure derived of functional data. It was found that, without gray matter signal regression (GSR), the group comparison showed no significant changes of the global metrics between the two conditions studied. With gray matter signal regression, significant differences between the global (local) metrics for the conditions were obtained. The mean degree, the clustering coefficient of the network and the mean value of the local efficiency were metrics with significant changes. The community structure of group connectivity matrices was explored for both conditions (RS and LT) and for different preprocessing steps. When gray matter signal regression was performed, small changes of the community structure were observed. Approximately, the same regions were classified in the same communities before and after GSR. This means, that the community structure of the data is weakly affected by this preprocessing step. The modularity index presented significant changes between conditions (RS and LT) and between different preprocessing pipeline.

            Working memory and conscious perception are thought to share similar brain mechanisms, yet recent reports of non-conscious working memory challenge this view. Combining visual masking with magnetoencephalography, we demonstrate the reality of non-conscious working memory and dissect its neural mechanisms. In a spatial delayed-response task, participants reported the location of a subjectively unseen target above chance-level after a long delay. Conscious perception and conscious working memory were characterized by similar signatures: a sustained desynchronization in the alpha/beta band over frontal cortex, and a decodable representation of target location in posterior sensors. During non-conscious working memory, such activity vanished. Our findings contradict models that identify working memory with sustained neural firing, but are compatible with recent proposals of 'activity-silent' working memory. We present a theoretical framework and simulations showing how slowly decaying synaptic changes allow cell assemblies to go dormant during the delay, yet be retrieved above chance-level after several seconds.

            Mental imagery provides an essential simulation tool for remembering the past and planning the future, and its strength affects both cognition and mental health. Research suggests that neural activity spanning prefrontal, parietal, temporal, and visual areas supports the generation of mental images. However, exactly how this network controls the strength of visual imagery remains unknown. Here, brain imaging and transcranial magnetic phosphene data show that lower resting activity and excitability levels in visual cortex (V1-V3), but higher levels in prefrontal cortex, predict stronger sensory imagery. Unlike visual perception, electrically decreasing visual cortex excitability increases imagery strength, while the inverse pattern emerged for prefrontal cortex. These data suggest a neurophysiological mechanism of network cortical excitability that controls the strength of mental images.

To address these questions, we analyzed whole mount preparations of the lateral ventricle by confocal microscopy using different extracellular matrix and cell markers, revealing laminin 5 as a major component of fractones, which were profusely distributed throughout the SVZ and appeared at the center of pinwheels, a critical site for adult neurogenesis. We demonstrate that fractones appear at the apical membrane of ependymal cells at the end of the first week after birth, and the use of transgenic mice lacking laminin 5 gene expression (Lama5) in endothelium and in FoxJ1-expressing ependymal cells, revealed ependymal cells as the source of laminin 5-containing fractones. Loss of laminin 5 from fractone bulbs correlated with an aberrant upregulation of laminin 2 and a two-fold increase in the proliferation of NSPCs, as determined by PH3 staining. These results indicate that fractones are a key component of the SVZ and that the laminin isoform composition at this site affects NSPC numbers.

            Recently, multiple focused efforts have resulted in substantial increase in the availability of connectome data in the fruit fly brain. Elucidating neural circuit function from such structural data calls for a scalable computational modeling methodology. We propose such a methodology that includes i) a brain emulation engine, with an architecture that can tackle the complexity of whole brain modeling, ii) a database that supports tight integration of biological and modeling data along with support for domain specific queries and circuit transformations, and iii) a graphical interface that allows for total flexibility in configuring neural circuits and visualizing run-time results, both anchored on model abstractions closely reflecting biological structure. Towards the realization of such a methodology, we have developed NeuroGFX and integrated it into the architecture of the Fruit Fly Brain Observatory (http://fruitflybrain.org). The computational infrastructure in NeuroGFX is provided by Neurokernel, an open source platform for the emulation of the fruit fly brain, and NeuroArch, a database for querying and executing fruit fly brain circuits. The integration of the two enables the algorithmic construction/manipulation/revision of executable circuits on multiple levels of abstraction of the same model organism. The power of this computational infrastructure can be leveraged through an intuitive graphical interface that allows visualizing execution results in the context of biological structure. This provides an environment where computational researchers can present configurable, executable neural circuits, and experimental scientists can easily explore circuit structure and function ultimately leading to biological validation. With these capabilities, NeuroGFX enables the exploration of function from circuit structure at whole brain, neuropil, and local circuit level of abstraction. By allowing for independently developed models to be integrated at the architectural level, NeuroGFX provides an open plug and play, collaborative environment for whole brain computational modeling of the fruit fly.

            NeuroNLP, is a key application on the Fruit Fly Brain Observatory platform (FFBO, http://fruitflybrain.org), that provides a modern web-based portal for navigating fruit fly brain circuit data. Increases in the availability and scale of fruit fly connectome data, demand new, scalable and accessible methods to facilitate investigation into the functions of the latest complex circuits being uncovered. NeuroNLP enables in-depth exploration and investigation of the structure of brain circuits, using intuitive natural language queries that are capable of revealing the latent structure and information, obscured due to expansive yet independent data sources. NeuroNLP is built on top of a database system call NeuroArch that codifies knowledge about the fruit fly brain circuits, spanning multiple sources. Users can probe biological circuits in the NeuroArch database with plain English queries, such as "show glutamatergic local neurons in the left antennal lobe" and "show neurons with dendrites in the left mushroom body and axons in the fan-shaped body". This simple yet powerful interface replaces the usual, cumbersome checkboxes and dropdown menus prevalent in today's neurobiological databases. Equipped with powerful 3D visualization, NeuroNLP standardizes tools and methods for graphical rendering, representation, and manipulation of brain circuits, while integrating with existing databases such as the FlyCircuit. The user-friendly graphical user interface complements the natural language queries with additional controls for exploring the connectivity of neurons and neural circuits. Designed with an open-source, modular structure, it is highly scalable/flexible/extensible to additional databases or to switch between databases and supports the creation of additional parsers for other languages. By supporting access through a web browser from any modern laptop or smartphone, NeuroNLP significantly increases the accessibility of fruit fly brain data and improves the impact of the data in both scientific and educational exploration.

            The Fruit Fly Brain Observatory (FFBO) is a collaborative effort between experimentalists, theorists and computational neuroscientists at Columbia University, National Tsing Hua University and Sheffield University with the goal to (i) create an open platform for the emulation and biological validation of fruit fly brain models in health and disease, (ii) standardize tools and methods for graphical rendering, representation and manipulation of brain circuits, (iii) standardize tools for representation of fruit fly brain data and its abstractions and support for natural language queries, (iv) create a focus for the neuroscience community with interests in the fruit fly brain and encourage the sharing of fruit fly brain structural data and executable code worldwide. NeuroNLP and NeuroGFX, two key FFBO applications, aim to address two major challenges, respectively: i) seamlessly integrate structural and genetic data from multiple sources that can be intuitively queried, effectively visualized and extensively manipulated, ii) devise executable brain circuit models anchored in structural data for understanding and developing novel hypotheses about brain function. NeuroNLP enables researchers to use plain English (or other languages) to probe biological data that are integrated into a novel database system, called NeuroArch, that we developed for integrating biological and abstract data models of the fruit fly brain. With powerful 3D graphical visualization, NeuroNLP presents a highly accessible portal for the fruit fly brain data. NeuroGFX provides users highly intuitive tools to execute neural circuit models with Neurokernel, an open-source platform for emulating the fruit fly brain, with full data support from the NeuroArch database and visualization support from an interactive graphical interface. Brain circuits can be configured with high flexibility and investigated on multiple levels, e.g., whole brain, neuropil, and local circuit levels. The FFBO is publicly available and accessible at http://fruitflybrain.org from any modern web browsers, including those running on smartphones.

            <p>by Kristen A. Marino, Diego Prada-Gracia, Davide Provasi, Marta Filizola</p>

The lipid composition of cell membranes has increasingly been recognized as playing an important role in the function of various membrane proteins, including G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). For instance, experimental and computational evidence has pointed to lipids influencing receptor oligomerization directly, by physically interacting with the receptor, and/or indirectly, by altering the bulk properties of the membrane. While the exact role of oligomerization in the function of class A GPCRs such as the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) is still unclear, insight as to how these receptors oligomerize and the relevance of the lipid environment to this phenomenon is crucial to our understanding of receptor function. To examine the effect of lipids and different MOR conformations on receptor oligomerization we carried out extensive coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of crystal structures of inactive and/or activated MOR embedded in an idealized mammalian plasma membrane composed of 63 lipid types asymmetrically distributed across the two leaflets. The results of these simulations point, for the first time, to specific direct and indirect effects of the lipids, as well as the receptor conformation, on the spatio-temporal organization of MOR in the plasma membrane. While sphingomyelin-rich, high-order lipid regions near certain transmembrane (TM) helices of MOR induce an effective long-range attractive force on individual protomers, both long-range lipid order and interface formation are found to be conformation dependent, with a larger number of different interfaces formed by inactive MOR compared to active MOR.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AwmsXEjft2Y" width="1" />

            <p>by James C. Schaff, Fei Gao, Ye Li, Igor L. Novak, Boris M. Slepchenko</p>

Hybrid deterministic-stochastic methods provide an efficient alternative to a fully stochastic treatment of models which include components with disparate levels of stochasticity. However, general-purpose hybrid solvers for spatially resolved simulations of reaction-diffusion systems are not widely available. Here we describe fundamentals of a general-purpose spatial hybrid method. The method generates realizations of a spatially inhomogeneous hybrid system by appropriately integrating capabilities of a deterministic partial differential equation solver with a popular particle-based stochastic simulator, Smoldyn. Rigorous validation of the algorithm is detailed, using a simple model of calcium ‘sparks’ as a testbed. The solver is then applied to a deterministic-stochastic model of spontaneous emergence of cell polarity. The approach is general enough to be implemented within biologist-friendly software frameworks such as Virtual Cell.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hVhBzj2nA_A" width="1" />

            <p>by Srikanth Ryali, Kaustubh Supekar, Tianwen Chen, John Kochalka, Weidong Cai, Jonathan Nicholas, Aarthi Padmanabhan, Vinod Menon</p>

Little is currently known about dynamic brain networks involved in high-level cognition and their ontological basis. Here we develop a novel Variational Bayesian Hidden Markov Model (VB-HMM) to investigate dynamic temporal properties of interactions between salience (SN), default mode (DMN), and central executive (CEN) networks—three brain systems that play a critical role in human cognition. In contrast to conventional models, VB-HMM revealed multiple short-lived states characterized by rapid switching and transient connectivity between SN, CEN, and DMN. Furthermore, the three “static” networks occurred in a segregated state only intermittently. Findings were replicated in two adult cohorts from the Human Connectome Project. VB-HMM further revealed immature dynamic interactions between SN, CEN, and DMN in children, characterized by higher mean lifetimes in individual states, reduced switching probability between states and less differentiated connectivity across states. Our computational techniques provide new insights into human brain network dynamics and its maturation with development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GEbniek7QUE" width="1" />

            <p>At its most fundamental level, touch sensation requires the translation of mechanical energy into mechanosensitive ion channel opening, thereby generating electro-chemical signals. Our understanding of this process, especially how the cytoskeleton influences it, remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that mice lacking the α-tubulin acetyltransferase Atat1 in sensory neurons display profound deficits in their ability to detect mechanical stimuli. We show that all cutaneous afferent subtypes, including nociceptors have strongly reduced mechanosensitivity upon Atat1 deletion, and that consequently, mice are largely insensitive to mechanical touch and pain. We establish that this broad loss of mechanosensitivity is dependent upon the acetyltransferase activity of Atat1, which when absent leads to a decrease in cellular elasticity. By mimicking α-tubulin acetylation genetically, we show both cellular rigidity and mechanosensitivity can be restored in Atat1 deficient sensory neurons. Hence, our results indicate that by influencing cellular stiffness, α-tubulin acetylation sets the force required for touch.</p>

            <p>Resident microbes play important roles in the development of the gastrointestinal tract, but their influence on other digestive organs is less well explored. Using the gnotobiotic zebrafish, we discovered that the normal expansion of the pancreatic β cell population during early larval development requires the intestinal microbiota and that specific bacterial members can restore normal β cell numbers. These bacteria share a gene that encodes a previously undescribed protein, named herein BefA (β Cell Expansion Factor A), which is sufficient to induce β cell proliferation in developing zebrafish larvae. Homologs of BefA are present in several human-associated bacterial species, and we show that they have conserved capacity to stimulate β cell proliferation in larval zebrafish. Our findings highlight a role for the microbiota in early pancreatic β cell development and suggest a possible basis for the association between low diversity childhood fecal microbiota and increased diabetes risk.</p>

            <p>Macropinocytosis is a fundamental mechanism that allows cells to take up extracellular liquid into large vesicles. It critically depends on the formation of a ring of protrusive actin beneath the plasma membrane, which develops into the macropinocytic cup. We show that macropinocytic cups in <em>Dictyostelium</em> are organised around coincident intense patches of PIP<sub>3</sub>, active Ras and active Rac. These signalling patches are invariably associated with a ring of active SCAR/WAVE at their periphery, as are all examined structures based on PIP<sub>3</sub> patches, including phagocytic cups and basal waves. Patch formation does not depend on the enclosing F-actin ring, and patches become enlarged when the RasGAP NF1 is mutated, showing that Ras plays an instructive role. New macropinocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones. We propose that cup-shaped plasma membrane structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP<sub>3</sub>, which recruit a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery.</p>

            <p>Bone marrow stromal cells maintain the adult skeleton by forming osteoblasts throughout life that regenerate bone and repair fractures. We discovered that subsets of these stromal cells, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and hypertrophic chondrocytes secrete a C-type lectin domain protein, Clec11a, which promotes osteogenesis. <em>Clec11a</em>-deficient mice appeared developmentally normal and had normal hematopoiesis but reduced limb and vertebral bone. <em>Clec11a</em>-deficient mice exhibited accelerated bone loss during aging, reduced bone strength, and delayed fracture healing. Bone marrow stromal cells from <em>Clec11a</em>-deficient mice showed impaired osteogenic differentiation, but normal adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. Recombinant Clec11a promoted osteogenesis by stromal cells in culture and increased bone mass in osteoporotic mice in vivo. Recombinant human Clec11a promoted osteogenesis by human bone marrow stromal cells in culture and in vivo. Clec11a thus maintains the adult skeleton by promoting the differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors into mature osteoblasts. In light of this, we propose to call this factor Osteolectin.</p>

            <p>Recreational drug use leads to compulsive substance abuse in some individuals. Studies on animal models of drug addiction indicate that persistent long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission onto ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons is a critical component of sustained drug seeking. However, little is known about the mechanism regulating such long-lasting changes in synaptic strength. Previously, we identified that translational control by eIF2α phosphorylation (p-eIF2α) regulates cocaine-induced LTP in the VTA (Huang et al., 2016). Here we report that in mice with reduced p-eIF2α-mediated translation, cocaine induces persistent LTP in VTA DA neurons. Moreover, selectively inhibiting eIF2α-mediated translational control with a small molecule ISRIB, or knocking down <em>oligophrenin-1</em>—an mRNA whose translation is controlled by p-eIF2α—in the VTA also prolongs cocaine-induced LTP. This persistent LTP is mediated by the insertion of GluR2-lacking AMPARs. Collectively, our findings suggest that eIF2α-mediated translational control regulates the progression from transient to persistent cocaine-induced LTP.</p>

            The acquisition and maintenance of the specific neuronal functions underlying learning, memory, and emotion require transduction of environmental stimuli into remodeling of neuronal circuitry. This process occurs via induction of plasticity-related transcriptional programs. The epigenetic enzyme lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1), also known as lysine demethylase 1A (KDM1A), and its neurospecific splicing variant neuroLSD1 have been implicated in this process through an antagonistic mechanism.

            Fifteen years ago, an influential model proposed that the human dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) detects conflict and induces adaptive control of behavior. Over the years support for this model has been mixed, in particular due to divergent findings in human versus nonhuman primates. We here review recent findings that suggest greater commonalities across species. These include equivalent behavioral consequences of conflict and similar neuronal signals in the dACC, but also a common failure of dACC lesions to reliably abolish conflict-driven behavior.

            Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) allows to non-invasively measure human brain activity at the millimeter scale. As such, it is widely used in computational neuroimaging studies that aim to build models to predict stimulus-induced neural responses in visual cortex. A popular method is population receptive field (PRF) mapping, which is able to characterize responses to a large range of stimuli. For each voxel, the PRF method estimates the best fitting receptive field properties (such as location and size in the visual field) using a coarse-to-fine approach which minimizes, but not eliminates, the risk of returning a local minimum. Here, we provide a Bayesian approach to the PRF method based on the slice sampler. Using this approach, we provide estimates of receptive field properties while at the same time being able to quantify their uncertainty. We test the performance of conventional and Bayesian approaches on simulated and empirical data.

            The ability to reliably and precisely deliver picolitre volumes is an important component of biological research. Here we describe a high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components. When connected to a standard micro-pipette via suitable pneumatic tubing, the device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide range of biological and chemical systems. In this work, we characterise the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial system using two-photon fluorescence microscopy. We found that Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of Openspritzer in a series of standard neurobiological applications. First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA to hippocampal neurons to elicit time- and dose-precise excitatory and inhibitory responses, respectively. Second, we used Openspritzer to deliver infectious viral and bacterial agents to living tissue. Viral transfection of hippocampal interneurons with channelrhodopsin allowed for the optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal circuitry with light. Finally, we successfully used Openspritzer to infect organotypic hippocampal slice cultures with fluorescent Mycobacterium bovis bacilli. We anticipate that due to its high performance and low cost Openspritzer will be of interest to a broad range of researchers working in the life and physical sciences.

            <p>by J. Patrick Pett, Anja Korenčič, Felix Wesener, Achim Kramer, Hanspeter Herzel</p>

Mammals evolved an endogenous timing system to coordinate their physiology and behaviour to the 24h period of the solar day. While it is well accepted that circadian rhythms are generated by intracellular transcriptional feedback loops, it is still debated which network motifs are necessary and sufficient for generating self-sustained oscillations. Here, we systematically explore a data-based circadian oscillator model with multiple negative and positive feedback loops and identify a series of three subsequent inhibitions known as “repressilator” as a core element of the mammalian circadian oscillator. The central role of the repressilator motif is consistent with time-resolved ChIP-seq experiments of circadian clock transcription factors and loss of rhythmicity in core clock gene knockouts.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/abKhxIM6ZtY" width="1" />

The simultaneous expression of the <i>hunchback</i> gene in the numerous nuclei of the developing fly embryo gives us a unique opportunity to study how transcription is regulated in living organisms. A recently developed MS2-MCP technique for imaging nascent messenger RNA in living <i>Drosophila</i> embryos allows us to quantify the dynamics of the developmental transcription process. The initial measurement of the morphogens by the <i>hunchback</i> promoter takes place during very short cell cycles, not only giving each nucleus little time for a precise readout, but also resulting in short time traces of transcription. Additionally, the relationship between the measured signal and the promoter state depends on the molecular design of the reporting probe. We develop an analysis approach based on tailor made autocorrelation functions that overcomes the short trace problems and quantifies the dynamics of transcription initiation. Based on live imaging data, we identify signatures of bursty transcription initiation from the <i>hunchback</i> promoter. We show that the precision of the expression of the <i>hunchback</i> gene to measure its position along the anterior-posterior axis is low both at the boundary and in the anterior even at cycle 13, suggesting additional post-transcriptional averaging mechanisms to provide the precision observed in fixed embryos.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jc5ovDoU9wo" width="1" />

            <p>Mechanistic studies of axon growth during development are beneficial to the search for neuron-intrinsic regulators of axon regeneration. Here, we discovered that, in the developing neuron from rat, Akt signaling regulates axon growth and growth cone formation through phosphorylation of serine 14 (S14) on Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2). This enhances Id2 protein stability by means of escape from proteasomal degradation, and steers its localization to the growth cone, where Id2 interacts with radixin that is critical for growth cone formation. Knockdown of <em>Id2,</em> or abrogation of Id2 phosphorylation at S14, greatly impairs axon growth and the architecture of growth cone. Intriguingly, reinstatement of Akt/Id2 signaling after injury in mouse hippocampal slices redeemed growth promoting ability, leading to obvious axon regeneration. Our results suggest that Akt/Id2 signaling is a key module for growth cone formation and axon growth, and its augmentation plays a potential role in CNS axonal regeneration.</p>

            <p>Neocortical GABAergic interneuron migration and thalamo-cortical axon (TCA) pathfinding follow similar trajectories and timing, suggesting they may be interdependent. The mechanisms that regulate the radial dispersion of neocortical interneurons are incompletely understood. Here we report that disruption of TCA innervation, or TCA-derived glutamate, affected the laminar distribution of GABAergic interneurons in mouse neocortex, resulting in abnormal accumulation in deep layers of interneurons that failed to switch from tangential to radial orientation. Expression of the KCC2 cotransporter was elevated in interneurons of denervated cortex, and KCC2 deletion restored normal interneuron lamination in the absence of TCAs. Disruption of interneuron NMDA receptors or pharmacological inhibition of calpain also led to increased KCC2 expression and defective radial dispersion of interneurons. Thus, although TCAs are not required to guide the tangential migration of GABAergic interneurons, they provide crucial signals that restrict interneuron KCC2 levels, allowing coordinated neocortical invasion of TCAs and interneurons.</p>

            <p>Site-specific fluorescent labeling of proteins inside live mammalian cells has been achieved by employing Streptolysin O, a bacterial enzyme which forms temporary pores in the membrane and allows delivery of virtually any fluorescent probes, ranging from labeled IgG’s to small ligands, with high efficiency (&gt;85% of cells). The whole process, including recovery, takes 30 min, and the cell is ready to be imaged immediately. A variety of cell viability tests were performed after treatment with SLO to ensure that the cells have intact membranes, are able to divide, respond normally to signaling molecules, and maintains healthy organelle morphology. When combined with Oxyrase, a cell-friendly photostabilizer, a ~20x improvement in fluorescence photostability is achieved. By adding in glutathione, fluorophores are made to blink, enabling super-resolution fluorescence with 20–30 nm resolution over a long time (~30 min) under continuous illumination. Example applications in conventional and super-resolution imaging of native and transfected cells include p65 signal transduction activation, single molecule tracking of kinesin, and specific labeling of a series of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein complexes.</p>

            <p>Activity-regulated genes (ARGs) are important for neuronal functions like long-term memory and are well-characterized in mammals but poorly studied in other model organisms like <em>Drosophila</em>. Here we stimulated fly neurons with different paradigms and identified ARGs using high-throughput sequencing from brains as well as from sorted neurons: they included a narrow set of circadian neurons as well as dopaminergic neurons. Surprisingly, many ARGs are specific to the stimulation paradigm and very specific to neuron type. In addition and unlike mammalian immediate early genes (IEGs), fly ARGs do not have short gene lengths and are less enriched for transcription factor function. Chromatin assays using ATAC-sequencing show that the transcription start sites (TSS) of ARGs do not change with neural firing but are already accessible prior to stimulation. Lastly based on binding site enrichment in ARGs, we identified transcription factor mediators of firing and created neuronal activity reporters.</p>

            <p>Spatial clustering of ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) through tertiary interactions is a striking structural feature of the eukaryotic ribosome. However, the functional importance of these intricate inter-connections, and how they are established is currently unclear. Here, we reveal that a conserved ATPase, Fap7, organizes interactions between neighboring r-proteins uS11 and eS26 prior to their delivery to the earliest ribosome precursor, the 90S. In vitro, uS11 only when bound to Fap7 becomes competent to recruit eS26 through tertiary contacts found between these r-proteins on the mature ribosome. Subsequently, Fap7 ATPase activity unloads the uS11:eS26 subcomplex onto its rRNA binding site, and therefore ensures stoichiometric integration of these r-proteins into the 90S. Fap7-depletion in vivo renders uS11 susceptible to proteolysis, and precludes eS26 incorporation into the 90S. Thus, prefabrication of a native-like r-protein subcomplex drives efficient and accurate construction of the eukaryotic ribosome.</p>

            <p>Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) undergoes spontaneous inactivation <em>via</em> global unfolding and this unfolding is prevented by GPIHBP1 (<a class="xref-bibr" href="https://elifesciences.org/#bib37">Mysling et al., 2016</a>). We now show: (1) that ANGPTL4 inactivates LPL by catalyzing the unfolding of its hydrolase domain; (2) that binding to GPIHBP1 renders LPL largely refractory to this inhibition; and (3) that both the LU domain and the intrinsically disordered acidic domain of GPIHBP1 are required for this protective effect. Genetic studies have found that a common polymorphic variant in ANGPTL4 results in lower plasma triglyceride levels. We now report: (1) that this ANGPTL4 variant is less efficient in catalyzing the unfolding of LPL; and (2) that its Glu-to-Lys substitution destabilizes its N-terminal α-helix. Our work elucidates the molecular basis for regulation of LPL activity by ANGPTL4, highlights the physiological relevance of the inherent instability of LPL, and sheds light on the molecular defects in a clinically relevant variant of ANGPTL4.</p>

            The impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) involves a combination of complex biochemical processes beginning with the initial insult and lasting for days, months and even years post-trauma. These changes range from neuronal integrity losses to neurotransmitter imbalance and metabolite dysregulation, leading to the release of pro- or anti-apoptotic factors which mediate cell survival or death. Such dynamic processes affecting the brain's neurochemistry can be monitored using a variety of neuroimaging techniques, whose combined use can be particularly useful for understanding patient-specific clinical trajectories.

            <p>Cortical networks exhibit intrinsic dynamics that drive coordinated, large-scale fluctuations across neuronal populations and create noise correlations that impact sensory coding. To investigate the network-level mechanisms that underlie these dynamics, we developed novel computational techniques to fit a deterministic spiking network model directly to multi-neuron recordings from different rodent species, sensory modalities, and behavioral states. The model generated correlated variability without external noise and accurately reproduced the diverse activity patterns in our recordings. Analysis of the model parameters suggested that differences in noise correlations across recordings were due primarily to differences in the strength of feedback inhibition. Further analysis of our recordings confirmed that putative inhibitory neurons were indeed more active during desynchronized cortical states with weak noise correlations. Our results demonstrate that network models with intrinsically-generated variability can accurately reproduce the activity patterns observed in multi-neuron recordings and suggest that inhibition modulates the interactions between intrinsic dynamics and sensory inputs to control the strength of noise correlations.</p>

            The balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs is critical for the proper functioning of neural circuits. Landau and colleagues show that, in the presence of cell-type-specific connectivity, this balance is difficult to achieve without either synaptic plasticity or spike-frequency adaptation to fine-tune the connection strength.

            <p>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep loss is associated with increased consumption of weight-promoting foods. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to mediate reward anticipation. However, the precise role of the PFC in mediating reward responses to highly palatable foods (HPF) after REM sleep deprivation is unclear. We selectively reduced REM sleep in mice over a 25–48 hr period and chemogenetically inhibited the medial PFC (mPFC) by using an altered glutamate-gated and ivermectin-gated chloride channel that facilitated neuronal inhibition through hyperpolarizing infected neurons. HPF consumption was measured while the mPFC was inactivated and REM sleep loss was induced. We found that REM sleep loss increased HPF consumption compared to control animals. However, mPFC inactivation reversed the effect of REM sleep loss on sucrose consumption without affecting fat consumption. Our findings provide, for the first time, a causal link between REM sleep, mPFC function and HPF consumption.</p>

            <p>Actin has well established functions in cellular morphogenesis. However, it is not well understood how the various actin assemblies in a cell are kept in a dynamic equilibrium, in particular when cells have to respond to acute signals. Here, we characterize a rapid and transient actin reset in response to increased intracellular calcium levels. Within seconds of calcium influx, the formin INF2 stimulates filament polymerization at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while cortical actin is disassembled. The reaction is then reversed within a few minutes. This Calcium-mediated actin reset (CaAR) occurs in a wide range of mammalian cell types and in response to many physiological cues. CaAR leads to transient immobilization of organelles, drives reorganization of actin during cell cortex repair, cell spreading and wound healing, and induces long-lasting changes in gene expression. Our findings suggest that CaAR acts as fundamental facilitator of cellular adaptations in response to acute signals and stress.</p>

            <p>Insulin and IGF signaling are critical to numerous developmental and physiological processes, with perturbations being pathognomonic of various diseases, including diabetes. Although the functional roles of the respective signaling pathways have been extensively studied, the control of insulin production and release is only partially understood. Herein, we show that in <em>Drosophila</em> expression of insulin-like peptides is regulated by neprilysin activity. Concomitant phenotypes of altered neprilysin expression included impaired food intake, reduced body size, and characteristic changes in the metabolite composition. Ectopic expression of a catalytically inactive mutant did not elicit any of the phenotypes, which confirms abnormal peptide hydrolysis as a causative factor. A screen for corresponding substrates of the neprilysin identified distinct peptides that regulate insulin-like peptide expression, feeding behavior, or both. The high functional conservation of neprilysins and their substrates renders the characterized principles applicable to numerous species, including higher eukaryotes and humans.</p>

            <p>DNA replication is a fundamental biological process. The initial step in eukaryotic DNA replication is the assembly of the pre-initiation complex, including the formation of two head-to-head hexameric helicases around the replication origin. How these hexameric helicases interact with their origin dsDNA remains unknown. Here, we report the co-crystal structure of the SV40 Large-T Antigen (LT) hexameric helicase bound to its origin dsDNA. The structure shows that the six subunits form a near-planar ring that interacts with the origin, so that each subunit makes unique contacts with the DNA. The origin dsDNA inside the narrower AAA+ domain channel shows partial melting due to the compression of the two phosphate backbones, forcing Watson-Crick base-pairs within the duplex to flip outward. This structure provides the first snapshot of a hexameric helicase binding to origin dsDNA, and suggests a possible mechanism of origin melting by LT during SV40 replication in eukaryotic cells.</p>

            <p>Brief experiences while a memory is consolidated may capture the consolidation, perhaps producing a maladaptive memory, or may interrupt the consolidation. Since consolidation occurs during sleep, even fleeting experiences when animals are awakened may produce maladaptive long-term memory, or may interrupt consolidation. In a learning paradigm affecting <em>Aplysia</em> feeding, when animals were trained after being awakened from sleep, interactions between new experiences and consolidation were prevented by blocking long-term memory arising from the new experiences. Inhibiting protein synthesis eliminated the block and allowed even a brief, generally ineffective training to produce long-term memory. Memory formation depended on consolidative proteins already expressed before training. After effective training, long term memory required subsequent transcription and translation. Memory formation during the sleep phase was correlated with increased CREB1 transcription, but not CREB2 transcription. Increased C/EBP transcription was a correlate of both effective and ineffective training and of treatments not producing memory.</p>

            <p>Left-right asymmetries in brains are usually minor or cryptic. We report brain asymmetries in the tiny, dorsal tubular nervous system of the ascidian tadpole larva, <em>Ciona intestinalis</em>. Chordate in body plan and development, the larva provides an outstanding example of brain asymmetry. Although early neural development is well studied, detailed cellular organization of the swimming larva’s CNS remains unreported. Using serial-section EM we document the synaptic connectome of the larva’s 177 CNS neurons. These formed 6618 synapses including 1772 neuromuscular junctions, augmented by 1206 gap junctions. Neurons are unipolar with at most a single dendrite, and few synapses. Some synapses are unpolarised, others form reciprocal or serial motifs; 922 were polyadic. Axo-axonal synapses predominate. Most neurons have ciliary organelles, and many features lack structural specialization. Despite equal cell numbers on both sides, neuron identities and pathways differ left/right. Brain vesicle asymmetries include a right ocellus and left coronet cells.</p>

Based on the identified segmental distribution of galaninergic neurons, the ability for penile vibratory stimulation (PVS) to elicit ejaculation when the concerned spinal segments were injured was studied in 384 patients with clinically complete spinal cord injury (SCI) and consequent anejaculation. Such patients represent a unique model to investigate the role of defined spinal segments in the control of ejaculation.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24819-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Galaninergic neurons were mostly located between L2 and L5 segments in medial lamina VII, with a maximal density within L4. Three-dimensional 3D reconstruction showed that these neurons were grouped into single columns bilaterally to the central canal. In addition, galaninergic neuron density was found higher in L3 and L4 segments in men as compared to women supporting sexual dimorphism. In the patients' cohort, injury of L3–L5 segments was the sole independent predictor for failure of PVS to induce ejaculation. Although evidence from clinical observations was indirect, there is close correspondence to neuroanatomical data.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24819-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Organization and sexual dimorphism of human spinal galaninergic neurons were similar to the rat's SEG.

            <p>Adult neurogenesis supports performance in many hippocampal dependent tasks. Considering the small number of adult-born neurons generated at any given time, it is surprising that this sparse population of cells can substantially influence behavior. Recent studies have demonstrated that heightened excitability and plasticity may be critical for the contribution of young adult-born cells for certain tasks. What is not well understood is how these unique biophysical and synaptic properties may translate to networks that support behavioral function. Here we employed a location discrimination task in mice while using optogenetics to transiently silence adult-born neurons at different ages. We discovered that adult-born neurons promote location discrimination during early stages of development but only if they undergo maturation during task acquisition. Silencing of young adult-born neurons also produced changes extending to the contralateral hippocampus, detectable by both electrophysiology and fMRI measurements, suggesting young neurons may modulate location discrimination through influences on bilateral hippocampal networks.</p>

            <p>Variation in the presence or absence of transposable elements (TEs) is a major source of genetic variation between individuals. Here, we identified 23,095 TE presence/absence variants between 216 Arabidopsis accessions. Most TE variants were rare, and we find these rare variants associated with local extremes of gene expression and DNA methylation levels within the population. Of the common alleles identified, two thirds were not in linkage disequilibrium with nearby SNPs, implicating these variants as a source of novel genetic diversity. Many common TE variants were associated with significantly altered expression of nearby genes, and a major fraction of inter-accession DNA methylation differences were associated with nearby TE insertions. Overall, this demonstrates that TE variants are a rich source of genetic diversity that likely plays an important role in facilitating epigenomic and transcriptional differences between individuals, and indicates a strong genetic basis for epigenetic variation.</p>

            <p>Protein Kinase A (PKA) mediates synaptic plasticity and is widely implicated in learning and memory. The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is thought to be responsible for processing and encoding distinct contextual associations in response to highly similar inputs. The mossy fiber (MF) axons of the dentate granule cells convey strong excitatory drive to CA3 pyramidal neurons and express presynaptic, PKA-dependent forms of plasticity. Here, we demonstrate an essential role for the PKA anchoring protein, AKAP7, in mouse MF axons and terminals. Genetic ablation of AKAP7 specifically from dentate granule cells results in disruption of MF-CA3 LTP directly initiated by cAMP, and the AKAP7 mutant mice are selectively deficient in pattern separation behaviors. Our results suggest that the AKAP7/PKA complex in the MF projections plays an essential role in synaptic plasticity and contextual memory formation.</p>

            <p>Apicomplexan parasites contain a conserved protein CelTOS that, in malaria parasites, is essential for traversal of cells within the mammalian host and arthropod vector. However, the molecular role of CelTOS is unknown because it lacks sequence similarity to proteins of known function. Here, we determined the crystal structure of CelTOS and discovered CelTOS resembles proteins that bind to and disrupt membranes. In contrast to known membrane disruptors, CelTOS has a distinct architecture, specifically binds phosphatidic acid commonly present within the inner leaflet of plasma membranes, and potently disrupts liposomes composed of phosphatidic acid by forming pores. Microinjection of CelTOS into cells resulted in observable membrane damage. Therefore, CelTOS is unique as it achieves nearly universal inner leaflet cellular activity to enable the exit of parasites from cells during traversal. By providing novel molecular insight into cell traversal by apicomplexan parasites, our work facilitates the design of therapeutics against global pathogens.</p>

            <p>The dichotomy between smooth and striated myocytes is fundamental for bilaterian musculature, but its evolutionary origin is unsolved. In particular, interrelationships of visceral smooth muscles remain unclear. Absent in fly and nematode, they have not yet been characterized molecularly outside vertebrates. Here, we characterize expression profile, ultrastructure, contractility and innervation of the musculature in the marine annelid <em>Platynereis dumerilii</em> and identify smooth muscles around the midgut, hindgut and heart that resemble their vertebrate counterparts in molecular fingerprint, contraction speed and nervous control. Our data suggest that both visceral smooth and somatic striated myocytes were present in the protostome-deuterostome ancestor and that smooth myocytes later co-opted the striated contractile module repeatedly – for example, in vertebrate heart evolution. During these smooth-to-striated myocyte conversions, the core regulatory complex of transcription factors conveying myocyte identity remained unchanged, reflecting a general principle in cell type evolution.</p>

            <p>Migration of skeletal muscle precursor cells is a key step during limb muscle development and depends on the activity of PAX3 and MET. Here, we demonstrate that BRAF serves a crucial function in formation of limb skeletal muscles during mouse embryogenesis downstream of MET and acts as a potent inducer of myoblast cell migration. We found that a fraction of BRAF accumulates in the nucleus after activation and endosomal transport to a perinuclear position. Mass spectrometry based screening for potential interaction partners revealed that BRAF interacts and phosphorylates PAX3. Mutation of BRAF dependent phosphorylation sites in PAX3 impaired the ability of PAX3 to promote migration of C2C12 myoblasts indicating that BRAF directly activates PAX3. Since PAX3 stimulates transcription of the <em>Met</em> gene we propose that MET signaling via BRAF fuels a positive feedback loop, which maintains high levels of PAX3 and MET activity required for limb muscle precursor cell migration.</p>

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: The main goal of dopamine cell replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) is to provide clinical benefit mediated by graft survival with nigrostriatal reinnervation. We report a dichotomy between graft structure and clinical function in a patient dying sixteen years following fetal nigral grafting.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: A 55-year-old levodopa-responsive woman with PD received bilateral putamenal fetal mesencephalic grafts as part of an NIH-sponsored double-blind sham-controlled trial. The patient never experienced clinical benefit and her course was complicated by the development of graft-related dyskinesias. Fluorodopa positron emission tomography (FD-PET) demonstrated significant increases post-grafting bilaterally. She experienced worsening of parkinsonism with severe dyskinesias, and underwent STN-DBS 8 years after grafting. She died 16-years post-transplantation.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Post-mortem analyses confirmed the diagnosis of PD and demonstrated &gt;300,000 tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive grafted cells per side with normalized striatal TH-ir fiber innervation and bidirectional synaptic connectivity. 27% and 17% of grafted neurons were serine 129-phosphorylated alpha synuclein positive in the left and right putamen respectively.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: These findings represent the largest number of surviving dopamine neurons and the densest and most widespread graft-mediated striatal dopamine reinnervation following a transplant procedure reported to date. Despite this, clinical recovery was not observed. Further, the grafts were associated with a form of dyskinesias that resembled diphasic dyskinesia and persisted in the off-medication state. We hypothesize that the grafted cells produced a low level of dopamine sufficient to cause a levodopa-independent continuous form of diphasic dyskinesias, but insufficient to provide an anti-parkinsonian benefit.

            <p>The Hsp104 disaggregase is a two-ring ATPase machine that rescues various forms of non-native proteins including the highly resistant amyloid fibers. The structural-mechanistic underpinnings of how the recovery of toxic protein aggregates is promoted and how this potent unfolding activity is prevented from doing collateral damage to cellular proteins are not well understood. Here, we present structural and biochemical data revealing the organization of Hsp104 from <em>Chaetomium thermophilum</em> at 3.7 Å resolution. We show that the coiled-coil domains encircling the disaggregase constitute a ‘restraint mask’ that sterically controls the mobility and thus the unfolding activity of the ATPase modules. In addition, we identify a mechanical linkage that coordinates the activity of the two ATPase rings and accounts for the high unfolding potential of Hsp104. Based on these findings, we propose a general model for how Hsp104 and related chaperones operate and are kept under control until recruited to appropriate substrates.</p>

            <p>Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in <em>Frataxin</em> (<em>FXN</em>). Loss of <em>FXN</em> causes impaired mitochondrial function and iron homeostasis. An elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was previously proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of FRDA. We recently showed that loss of <em>frataxin homolog</em> (<em>fh</em>), a <em>Drosophila</em> homolog of <em>FXN</em>, causes a ROS independent neurodegeneration in flies (Chen et al., 2016). In <em>fh</em> mutants, iron accumulation in the nervous system enhances the synthesis of sphingolipids, which in turn activates 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdk1) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2) to trigger neurodegeneration of adult photoreceptors. Here, we show that loss of <em>Fxn</em> in the nervous system in mice also activates an iron/sphingolipid/PDK1/Mef2 pathway, indicating that the mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore, sphingolipid levels and PDK1 activity are also increased in hearts of FRDA patients, suggesting that a similar pathway is affected in FRDA.</p>

            <p>Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation is mediated by soluble and physical cues. In this study, we investigated differentiation-induced transformations in MSC cellular and nuclear biophysical properties and queried their role in mechanosensation. Our data show that nuclei in differentiated bovine and human MSCs stiffen and become resistant to deformation. This attenuated nuclear deformation was governed by restructuring of Lamin A/C and increased heterochromatin content. This change in nuclear stiffness sensitized MSCs to mechanical-loading-induced calcium signaling and differentiated marker expression. This sensitization was reversed when the ‘stiff’ differentiated nucleus was softened and was enhanced when the ‘soft’ undifferentiated nucleus was stiffened through pharmacologic treatment. Interestingly, dynamic loading of undifferentiated MSCs, in the absence of soluble differentiation factors, stiffened and condensed the nucleus, and increased mechanosensitivity more rapidly than soluble factors. These data suggest that the nucleus acts as a mechanostat to modulate cellular mechanosensation during differentiation.</p>

            <p>Social insects frequently engage in oral fluid exchange – trophallaxis – between adults, and between adults and larvae. Although trophallaxis is widely considered a food-sharing mechanism, we hypothesized that endogenous components of this fluid might underlie a novel means of chemical communication between colony members. Through protein and small-molecule mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing, we found that trophallactic fluid in the ant <em>Camponotus floridanus</em> contains a set of specific digestion- and non-digestion related proteins, as well as hydrocarbons, microRNAs, and a key developmental regulator, juvenile hormone. When <em>C. floridanus</em> workers’ food was supplemented with this hormone, the larvae they reared via trophallaxis were twice as likely to complete metamorphosis and became larger workers. Comparison of trophallactic fluid proteins across social insect species revealed that many are regulators of growth, development and behavioral maturation. These results suggest that trophallaxis plays previously unsuspected roles in communication and enables communal control of colony phenotypes.</p>

            <p>In multicellular organisms, cells adopt various shapes, from flattened sheets of endothelium to dendritic neurons, that allow the cells to function effectively. Here, we elucidated the unique shape of cells in the cornified stratified epithelia of the mammalian epidermis that allows them to achieve homeostasis of the tight junction (TJ) barrier. Using intimate in vivo 3D imaging, we found that the basic shape of TJ-bearing cells is a flattened Kelvin's tetrakaidecahedron (f-TKD), an optimal shape for filling space. In vivo live imaging further elucidated the dynamic replacement of TJs on the edges of f-TKD cells that enables the TJ-bearing cells to translocate across the TJ barrier. We propose a spatiotemporal orchestration model of f-TKD cell turnover, where in the classic context of 'form follows function', cell shape provides a fundamental basis for the barrier homeostasis and physical strength of cornified stratified epithelia.</p>

            <p>This study examines how temporally patterned stimuli are transformed as they propagate from primary to secondary zones in the thalamorecipient auditory pallium in zebra finches. Using a new class of synthetic click stimuli, we find a robust mapping from temporal sequences in the primary zone to distinct population vectors in secondary auditory areas. We tested whether songbirds could discriminate synthetic click sequences in an operant setup and found that a robust behavioral discrimination is present for click sequences composed of intervals ranging from 11 ms to 40 ms, but breaks down for stimuli composed of longer inter-click intervals. This work suggests that the analog of the songbird auditory cortex transforms temporal patterns to sequence-selective population responses or ‘spatial codes', and that these distinct population responses contribute to behavioral discrimination of temporally complex sounds.</p>

            <p>Robust preference for fermentative glucose metabolism has motivated domestication of the budding yeast <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>. This program can be circumvented by a protein-based genetic element, the [<em>GAR</em><sup>+</sup>] prion, permitting simultaneous metabolism of glucose and other carbon sources. Diverse bacteria can elicit yeast cells to acquire [<em>GAR</em><sup>+</sup>], although the molecular details of this interaction remain unknown. Here we identify the common bacterial metabolite lactic acid as a strong [<em>GAR</em><sup>+</sup>] inducer. Transient exposure to lactic acid caused yeast cells to heritably circumvent glucose repression. This trait had the defining genetic properties of [<em>GAR</em><sup>+</sup>], and did not require utilization of lactic acid as a carbon source. Lactic acid also induced [<em>GAR</em><sup>+</sup>]-like epigenetic states in fungi that diverged from <em>S. cerevisiae</em> ~200 million years ago, and in which glucose repression evolved independently. To our knowledge, this is the first study to uncover a bacterial metabolite with the capacity to potently induce a prion.</p>

            <p>Animals require molecular signals to determine when to divert resources from somatic functions to reproduction. This decision is vital in animals that reproduce in an all-or-nothing mode, such as bristle worms: females committed to reproduction spend roughly half their body mass for yolk and egg production; following mass spawning, the parents die. An enigmatic brain hormone activity suppresses reproduction. We now identify this hormone as the sesquiterpenoid methylfarnesoate. Methylfarnesoate suppresses transcript levels of the yolk precursor Vitellogenin both in cell culture and <em>in vivo</em>, directly inhibiting a central energy–costly step of reproductive maturation. We reveal that contrary to common assumptions, sesquiterpenoids are ancient animal hormones present in marine and terrestrial lophotrochozoans. In turn, insecticides targeting this pathway suppress vitellogenesis in cultured worm cells. These findings challenge current views of animal hormone evolution, and indicate that non-target species and marine ecosystems are susceptible to commonly used insect larvicides.</p>

            <p>The multi-domain splicing factor RBM5 regulates the balance between antagonistic isoforms of the apoptosis-control genes <em>FAS/CD95</em>, <em>Caspase-2</em> and <em>AID</em>. An OCRE (OCtamer REpeat of aromatic residues) domain found in RBM5 is important for alternative splicing regulation and mediates interactions with components of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP. We show that the RBM5 OCRE domain adopts a unique β–sheet fold. NMR and biochemical experiments demonstrate that the OCRE domain directly binds to the proline-rich C-terminal tail of the essential snRNP core proteins SmN/B/B’. The NMR structure of an OCRE-SmN peptide complex reveals a specific recognition of poly-proline helical motifs in SmN/B/B’. Mutation of conserved aromatic residues impairs binding to the Sm proteins <em>in vitro</em> and compromises RBM5-mediated alternative splicing regulation of FAS/CD95. Thus, RBM5 OCRE represents a poly-proline recognition domain that mediates critical interactions with the C-terminal tail of the spliceosomal SmN/B/B’ proteins in <em>FAS/CD95</em> alternative splicing regulation.</p>

            <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>—Several prion amplification systems have been proposed for detection of prions in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), most recently, the measurements of prion seeding activity with second-generation real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC). The objective of this study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of the RT-QuIC prion test in the broad phenotypic spectrum of prion diseases.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>— We performed CSF RT-QuIC testing in 2,141 patients who had rapidly progressive neurological disorders, determined diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in 272 cases which were autopsied, and evaluated the impact of mutations and polymorphisms in the <em>PRNP</em> gene, and Type 1 or Type 2 of human prions on diagnostic performance.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>—The 98.5% diagnostic specificity and 92% sensitivity of CSF RT-QuIC in a blinded retrospective analysis matched the 100% specificity and 95% sensitivity of a blind prospective study. The CSF RT-QuIC differentiated 94% of cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) MM1 from the sCJD MM2 phenotype, and 80% of sCJD VV2 from sCJD VV1. The mixed prion type 1-2 and cases heterozygous for codon 129 generated intermediate CSF RT-QuIC patterns, while genetic prion diseases revealed distinct profiles for each <em>PRNP</em> gene mutation.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>—The diagnostic performance of the improved CSF RT-QuIC is superior to surrogate marker tests for prion diseases such as 14-3-3 and Tau proteins and together with <em>PRNP</em> gene sequencing, the test allows the major prion subtypes to be differentiated in vivo. This differentiation facilitates prediction of the clinicopathological phenotype and duration of the disease—two important considerations for envisioned therapeutic interventions.

            <p>Previous studies provided evidence for the alteration of brain cholesterol homeostasis in 129.<em>Mecp2</em>-null mice, an experimental model of Rett syndrome. The efficacy of statins in improving motor symptoms and prolonging survival of mutant mice suggested a potential role of statins in the therapy of Rett syndrome. In the present study, we show that <em>Mecp2</em> deletion had no effect on brain and reduced serum cholesterol levels and lovastatin (1.5 mg/kg, twice weekly as in the previous study) had no effects on motor deficits and survival when <em>Mecp2</em> deletion was expressed on a background strain (C57BL/6J; B6) differing from that used in the earlier study. These findings indicate that the effects of statins may be background specific and raise important issues to consider when contemplating clinical trials. The reduction of the brain cholesterol metabolite 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC) found in B6.<em>Mecp2</em>-null mice suggests the occurrence of changes in brain cholesterol metabolism and the potential utility of using plasma levels of 24S-OHC as a biomarker of brain cholesterol homeostasis in RTT.</p>

            <p>Natural isolates of <em>C. elegans</em> differ in their sensitivity to pheromones that inhibit exploratory behavior. Previous studies identified a QTL for pheromone sensitivity that includes alternative alleles of <em>srx-43,</em> a chemoreceptor that inhibits exploration through its activity in ASI sensory neurons. Here we show that the QTL is multigenic and includes alternative alleles of <em>srx-44,</em> a second chemoreceptor gene that modifies pheromone sensitivity. <em>srx-44</em> either promotes or inhibits exploration depending on its expression in the ASJ or ADL sensory neurons, respectively. Naturally occurring pheromone insensitivity results in part from previously described changes in <em>srx-43</em> expression levels, and in part from increased <em>srx-44</em> expression in ASJ, which antagonizes ASI and ADL. Antagonism between the sensory neurons results in cellular epistasis that is reflected in their transcription of insulin genes that regulate exploration. These results and genome-wide evidence suggest that chemoreceptor genes may be preferred sites of adaptive variation in <em>C. elegans</em>.</p>

<div class="section" id="ana24803-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Excessive lipofuscin accumulation was observed in abnormal dysmorphic neurones in 6 cases, but not in seven FCD type IIB and 7 pathology-negative cases, despite similar age and seizure histories. Abnormal dysmorphic neurones on proteomics analysis were comparable to aged human brains. The mTOR pathway was activated, as in cases with dysplasia, but the immunoreactivities of nucleoporin p62, DEP-domain containing protein 5, clathrin, and dynamin-1 were different between groups, suggesting that enhanced autophagy flux and abnormal synaptic vesicle trafficking contribute to early lipofuscin aggregation in these cases, compared to suppression of autophagy in cases with typical dysplasia. Cases with abnormal neuronal lipofuscin showed subtle magnetic resonance imaging cortical abnormalities that localized with seizure onset zone and were more likely to have a family history.</p></div></div>

            <div class="section" id="ana24800-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation drives production of toxic proteins from pathogenic repeat sequences in multiple untreatable neurodegenerative disorders. Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is one such condition, resulting from a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5′ leader sequence of the <em>FMR1</em> gene. RAN proteins from the CGG repeat accumulate in ubiquitinated inclusions in FXTAS patient brains and elicit toxicity. In addition to the CGG repeat, an antisense mRNA containing a CCG repeat is also transcribed from the <em>FMR1</em> locus. We evaluated whether this antisense CCG repeat supports RAN translation and contributes to pathology in FXTAS patients.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24800-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>We generated a series of CCG RAN translation-specific reporters and utilized them to measure RAN translation from CCG repeats in multiple reading frames in transfected cells.

Antibodies targeted to the antisense FMR polyproline and polyalanine proteins selectively stain nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates in FXTAS patients and colocalize with ubiquitinated neuronal inclusions.</p></div></div>

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a negative prognostic factor in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and is associated with permanent shunt dependency in a substantial proportion of patients after ICH. IVH treatment by intraventricular fibrinolysis (IVF) was recently linked to reduced mortality rates in the CLEAR III study and IVF represents a safe and effective strategy to hasten clot resolution that may reduce shunt rates. Additionally, promising results from observational studies reported reductions in shunt dependency for a combined treatment approach of IVF plus lumbar drains (LD). The present randomized controlled trial investigated efficacy and safety of a combined strategy – IVF plus LD <em>versus</em> IVF alone – on shunt dependency in patients with ICH and severe IVH.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>This randomized, open-label, parallel-group study included patients aged 18-85 years, pre-hospital modified Rankin Scale ≤3, ICH volume &lt;60 ml, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of &lt;9, and severe IVH with tamponade of the third and fourth ventricles requiring placement of external ventricular drainage (EVD). Over a 3 year recruitment period, patients were allocated to either standard treatment (control group receiving intraventricular fibrinolysis (IVF) consisting of 1 mg rt-PA every 8 hours until clot-clearance of 3rd and 4th ventricles) or a combined treatment approach of IVF and – upon clot-clearance of 3rd and 4th ventricles – subsequent placement of a LD for drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (intervention group). The primary endpoint consisted of permanent shunt placement indicated after a total of three unsuccessful EVD clamping attempts or need for CSF-drainage longer than 14 days in both groups. Secondary endpoints included IVF- and LD-related safety, such as bleeding or infections, and functional outcome at 90 and 180 days. Conducted endpoint analyses employed individual patient data meta-analyses. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01041950).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The trial was stopped upon pre-defined interim analysis after 30 patients because of significant efficacy of tested intervention. The primary endpoint was analyzed without dropouts and was reached in 43%(7/16) of the control group <em>versus</em> 0%(0/14) of the intervention group(p=0.007). Meta-analyses were based on overall 97 patients, 45 patients receiving IVF plus LD <em>versus</em> 42 patients with IVF only. Meta-analyses on shunt-dependency showed an absolute risk-reduction of 24% for the intervention (LD:2.2%(1/45) <em>versus</em> no-LD:26.2%(11/42)); odds-ratio=0.062,CI(0.011-0.361),p=0.002. Secondary endpoints did not show significant differences for CSF-infections (OR=0.869,CI(0.445-1.695),p=0.680) and functional outcome at 90 days (OR=0.478,CI(0.190-1.201),p=0.116), yet bleeding complications were significantly reduced in favor of the intervention (OR=0.401,CI(0.302-0.532),p&lt;0.001).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The present trial and individual patient data meta-analyses provides evidence that in patients with severe IVH, as compared to IVF alone, a combined approach of IVF plus LD treatment is feasible and safe, and significantly reduces rates of permanent shunt dependency for aresorptive hydrocephalus after ICH.

            50 years ago, scientists made plans to use nuclear explosions to extract natural gas from underground. In one such experiment, the gas was released but turned out to be radioactive.
